It's a tiny blip, and we really need to move forward as a species because this is getting really stupid.  ||| Fully agree. I think the reason why fiat has survived this long is because you can somewhat protect yourself from debasement, so it's not as brutal as if everyone was forced to save in fiat. 

It's still a net negative. You can't fully escape it, and it's hard to understand when your the victim, and to what degree. 

The fact alone that you can't really use it as a measuring stick is wild.

I think bitcoin will kill fiat, but I have no idea what the transition will look like. We really need people to get paid in bitcoin, and live on a bitcoin standard, but it really needs to be a broad adoption, otherwise your paycheck would just be a direct conversion from fiat, which makes no difference. It really should be a circular economy, where you get paid in bitcoin, and the company you work for generate their profits from products they sell for bitcoin. 

Anyway, before any of that can happen we need a lot more adoption, and the price need to stabilize. We're far from this reality, so I think it's fine that people just use it as a store of value for now. ||| Well said, sir! ||| I agree! 

I do genuinely want to understand from a deeper/philosophical/historical point of view about whether money SHOULD hold value and how compatible/incompatible that is with our current society. Money LOSING value contributes to some of the evils we see around us: overconsumption, trash in landfills and easy indebtedness. I want to make up my own mind how bad “deflationary forces” is for an economic system. 

I also made this comic, which I believe resonates with your post. Bitcoin is the opposite of fiat, and that means the fact that it exists is enough. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/ProofofSheilaComics/s/8yhLpRl5mh ||| Even if it were true that Bitcoin is ""just money"", that misses the fact it might be the ""best money."" And since all monies compete for market share, the combination of limited supply and increasing visibility, robustness and validation, are pushing Bitcoin's price to new highs.

But I believe it will take more and more market cap from gold and other hard monies, and that alone points to one million within a decade."

You can buy bitcoin directly from someone that owns bitcoin and that is willing to sell you some. You can buy bitcoin from someone that you meet at a Bitcoin meetup that is willing to sell you some bitcoin. You can buy bitcoin from a bitcoin seller that advertises on a classified ad website like Craigslist/Gumtree/Facebook Marketplace. Or you can use a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency exchange to easily find someone that is willing to sell you some bitcoin.

1nyjv3k;Why is the total Bitcoin supply capped at 21 million and not, say, 20 million or 30 million? Was there a specific economic reason behind that number, or was it more of an arbitrary choice by Satoshi?;Legit-buyerworldwide;3;23;1759657000.0;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1nyjv3k/why_is_the_total_bitcoin_supply_capped_at_21/;"Below is a quote from an email that Satoshi sent to Mike Hearn on 12 April 2009.

""My choice for the number of coins and distribution schedule was an educated guess. It was a difficult choice, because once the network is going it's locked in and we're stuck with it. I wanted to pick something that would make prices similar to existing currencies, but without knowing the future, that's very hard. I ended up picking something in the middle. If Bitcoin remains a small niche, it'll be worth less per unit than existing currencies. If you imagine it being used for some fraction of world commerce, then there's only going to be 21 million coins for the whole world, so it would be worth much more per unit. Values are 64-bit integers with 8 decimal places, so 1 coin is represented internally as 100000000. There's plenty of granularity if typical prices become small. For example, if 0.001 is worth 1 Euro, then it might be easier to change where the decimal point is displayed, so if you had 1 Bitcoin it's now displayed as 1000, and 0.001 is displayed as 1."" ||| Because 22 million is too much! ||| 
 The 21M bitcoin limit was not so much chosen as it was the result of other design choices.  

Satoshi wanted the halving to be roughly every 4 years.  For blocks to be solved every ten minutes.   That means 210,0000 blocks per halving was an easy rounding to work with. 

210,000 blocks per halving.  Starting at 50 BTC reward per block and decreasing block rewards in a geometric series gives 21M when the last halving hits. ||| [https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Controlled\_supply](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Controlled_supply) ||| Probably the 21,000,000th time this question is asked on this sub"

I have a bitcoin business. ||| I think this is largely correct. In general, as bitcoiners we're way too bullish, and that means we tend to be ""too early"" for our bitcoin business ideas, which is the worst timing possible for a startup. 

We're 15+ years in and there are still very few examples of revenue-driving bitcoin startups, especially startups that drive enough revenue to justify VC investment.

HOWEVER, if you're absolutely and truly driven by a passion for participating in the inception of the bitcoin industry, more so than you are concerned with maximizing your stack/quality of life, then it's still a good idea to start/join a bitcoin startup. It's exciting, you're learning things that no one else is, lots of crazy stories, and still enough money flying around to make a decent living. 

And if we're right about this whole bitcoin thing, one of these days we're not going to be too early, the timing's going to be \*just right\*, and if you have a great idea well executed, you're going to do A LOT better than if you'd prioritized mining fiat. ||| what bitcoin business can i start 🤔"

Many of us are all in and as of today, everyone who ever bought BTC and held on to it is in the green. Let that sink in for a moment. 

I’d start with monthly DCA and keep it going for as long as you can, or if you want to lump sum, put in half now and the rest over time. 

There really is no % that is a safe recommendation.

100% BTC nothing else really outperformes the market. ||| Pick any percentage you want.  Let’s say you pick 30%.  So in five years, it’s now 60% of your portfolio.  Are you going to bite the bullet, sell off half your coin to rebalance, pay gains tax, and then look around to see what the best investments are?  Or just “suffer” having an unbalanced portfolio?

Ask yourself a few questions. What is your financial end-goal? Is the house an investment or do you need it because of a personal/family situation? Can you live a few more years without a house? Why do you start thinking about real estate a this exact moment? Why did you buy crypto in the first place? What will you do if crypo/real estate looses a lot of value in a short period of time?
Maybe the answers to these questions will show you a suitable path for you. Good luck, m80 ||| If the loan interest is lower than the average increase of BTC price, then it makes no sense to sell the coins, obviously. Otherwise, within 5 years you'll be de facto living in a 20-million dollar house that *looks* nothing like it.

memorizing is normally a bad idea, but if you know it's temporary, and you'll forget it again, that would probably also work.

You could also generate a new wallet in EU (or reuse the current one), and store it somewhere safe, move to the new country and generate 2 wallets. You can now set up a 2-of-3 multi sig that's geographically distributed. You would end up with 2 wallets at the same place in the new country, so maybe not ideal. Maybe collaborative custody would be better, your 2 seeds are geographically distributed, and the 3rd is held by a 3rd party. You could set up spending limits, so if you want to move large amounts, you would need to go back home.  

Maybe this is more than what you are looking for, but I think it's worth thinking about. I think I would sleep better at night with a more complex setup.

1nxwt46;Transfer from Bitget to a Hot Wallet;debtmechanic15;3;2;1759591296.0;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1nxwt46/transfer_from_bitget_to_a_hot_wallet/;"BlueWallet is pretty straightforward.

Part 1: Set Up Your BlueWallet and Get the Receive Address

If you haven't created a Bitcoin wallet in BlueWallet yet:
Open the BlueWallet app and tap the + icon in the top-right corner (or the ""Add now"" button) to go to the ""Add wallet"" screen.
Select Bitcoin as the wallet type.
(Optional) Name your wallet or leave the default.
If advanced mode is enabled (in settings), choose a wallet type—SegWit HD (BIP84 Bech32 - Native) is recommended for lower fees and better privacy.
Tap Create to generate the wallet. Back up your 12-word seed phrase securely (write it down offline and never share it).
To get your receive address:
Tap on your new Bitcoin wallet in the app.
Select Receive.
Your BTC receive address (starting with ""bc1..."" for SegWit) will display. Tap it to copy to your clipboard, or use the Share button to send it via messaging. You can also tap Receive with amount to generate a QR code or invoice with a specific amount.
Note: BlueWallet supports the Bitcoin network (on-chain BTC). Always use a fresh address for privacy, but the same one is fine for this transfer. Transactions may take 10–60 minutes to confirm, depending on network fees.

Part 2: Withdraw BTC from Bitget
Log in to your Bitget account on the website (bitget.com) or app. For the website: Click your profile icon in the top-right and select Withdraw.
Search for and select BTC from the cryptocurrency list.
Paste your BlueWallet receive address into the ""Address"" field. (Use the QR scanner if on mobile.)
Ensure the network is set to Bitcoin (BTC) or BTC (Native SegWit) to match BlueWallet—mismatches can lead to lost funds.
Enter the amount of BTC to withdraw. The interface will show the withdrawal fee (typically 0.0005 BTC or similar, deducted automatically) and the net amount arriving in your wallet. Minimum withdrawal is usually around 0.0005 BTC—check the exact limit in the interface.
Double-check everything: address, amount, network, and fees. Click Withdraw.
Complete security verification: Enter your email/SMS code and Google Authenticator 2FA code.

Part 3: Confirm and Monitor the Transfer
After submission, go to Assets > Deposit/Withdrawal in Bitget to track the status (e.g., Processing > Completed).
In BlueWallet, refresh your wallet or check the Transactions tab—the incoming BTC will appear once confirmed on the blockchain (usually 1–3 confirmations needed).
Use a blockchain explorer like Blockchair.com (search your address) for real-time tracking.
Important Notes and Warnings

Fees: Bitget charges a fixed withdrawal fee for BTC (displayed during the process; around 0.0005 BTC as of recent data). Network fees are included. BlueWallet doesn't charge for receiving.

Limits: Daily/monthly withdrawal limits depend on your verification level (e.g., up to 100 BTC/day for advanced users).

Time: Transfers are usually fast but can delay due to Bitcoin network congestion.

Security: Never share your seed phrase. Test with a small amount (e.g., 0.001 BTC) first if you're new. Withdrawals are irreversible—triple-check the address!

Support: If issues arise, contact Bitget support via their app/site or BlueWallet's help docs.

This process should complete your transfer securely. If you encounter errors, verify your setup or reach out to the platforms' support. ||| >reputable hotwallet

I sold the bitcoin and paid this loan. 

I moved my retirement 401(k) into a bitcoin IRA.

I owe the IRS $2000.00 for taxes now. And I am saving $ to pay this tax.

I have more bitcoin than I ever thought I can get.  And I formed habits: cook at home, no buying any fun toys, no wasting on eating out, follow disciplined life and buy bitcoin at any price. I keep buying if it is up or down. Month by month.

I can afford my lifestyle, my debits are very low. I have money in case if emergency.

At first, I simply accepted what I had read in the mainstream media  that it was just some “blockchain invention,” a big hype, and similar nonsense. But once I started going deeper down the rabbit hole and read *The Bitcoin Standard*, it hit me: “Oh my God, this is something much bigger than I thought.

After that, I read *Broken Money* and then *The Fiat Standard*. That’s when I truly began to understand what money really is, and I started studying the history and evolution of money itself.After reading *The Fiat Standard*, I realized that the current monetary system is essentially a complete fraud. That book opened my eyes to how the system is designed to silently extract value from people through inflation and debt. It was at that moment that everything I had thought I knew about money completely changed. ||| Understanding money and extrinsic value ||| Jeff booth. ||| Oh that’s easy I remember sitting in Econ class arguing Keynesian economics in 2007, I didn’t know it at the time, but i was making the case Bitcoin, I didn’t find it until 2013 and really didn’t understand it till 2017. The more I learned the more I realized our economy is nothing but a rigged game designed around inflation. 

Here’s my rundown of Keynesian Economics which is the system our economist and leaders implement in the US. Study the difference between Austrian economics and Keynesian. 
	
1.	The economy’s main driver is aggregate demand, meaning total spending by consumers, businesses, and government.
	
2.	When demand falls, output and employment contract, and the economy can stagnate for years without outside intervention.
	
3.	The government’s role is to step in when private spending drops, using public investment and temporary tax relief to restore confidence.
	
4.	Fiscal policy, or government spending and taxation, is the most powerful tool during recessions, especially when interest rates are near zero. (We’ve blurred the line between fiscal and monetary policy, funding government deficits through money creation and cheap credit.)
	
5.	Monetary policy, which uses interest rates to manage demand, helps fine-tune the system but cannot rescue a deep downturn by itself.
	
6.	The multiplier effect means each new dollar of spending should create more than a dollar of economic activity. (We’ve expanded the money supply massively, but instead of building productive assets or infrastructure, much of it flows into financial markets and transfer programs.)
	
7.	Counter-cyclical policy means spending during slumps and saving during booms. (We abandoned the saving part, running deficits in both good and bad times.)
	
8.	Moderate inflation is considered acceptable if it prevents mass unemployment. (Today we see stagnation across most sectors except tech and defense, while real estate remains inflated due to underlying currency devaluation, supply scarcity, and its nature as a tangible, income-producing asset.)
	
9.	Keynesianism assumes markets can fail to self-correct because of pessimism or hoarding. (In today’s economy, extreme wealth concentration acts as a modern form of hoarding, with capital sitting idle or cycling through financial assets instead of real production.)

	10.	The goal is full employment and stable growth through managed demand rather than pure free-market adjustment. (In practice, temporary stimulus has become permanent policy, creating endless deficit spending framed as economic relief.) ||| When a friend tried to tell me about it in 2011 I was convinced it was a new amway style ponzi.

120K, 150K, etc., whatever. You fast-forward a few years, these numbers will no longer be mentioned.

It's people making money with ""investments"".

Not sure what you mean by ""trading experience"" or ""breakout pain"". Timing the entry? That's a pretty bad strategy. Managing volatility? What's wrong with volatility? 

In finance, volatility is measured by a simple measurement called standard deviation (the range of volatility when compared to the average). Standard deviation (volatility) is associated with the average. Typically speaking, more volatility means higher risk, which requires a higher return.

The average return for BTC is huge because of the volatility. Investors must be rewarded for the risk, therefore, the returns.

This is basic market theory, across all investments.

I'm using Bitcoin almost on a daily basis. Buying groceries, paying for meals, taxis, domains/hosting, VPN...

Spend and replace is usually the name of the game so no, I'm not spending bitcoin while saving in cash. 


If you're thinking about spending some, here are my favorite directories:

http://lightningnetworkstores.com/

https://btcmap.org - awesome map, you can even add your local vendors in, once you orangepill them. 

https://acceptlightning.com/list.html

https://spendabit.co/

https://directory.btcpayserver.org/

There's also an option of buying gift cards 



https://thebitcoincompany.com/

https://bitrefill.com

https://www.egifter.com/buy-gift-cards-with-bitcoin - this one's least fave because they use a shitty custodian for payments but are handy for a few cards. 


Spend and earn some sats back: 

https://foldapp.com - save up to 20% Starbucks, Uber, Target , whole foods , Dunkin

https://www.lolli.com – save up to 30% by spending BTC anywhere but primarily USA stores

https://satsback.com/stores-list - save up to 20% by spending BTC anywhere but primarily Europe stores. ||| There are some companies / stores that do accept bitcoin payments ||| Bitcoin is perfect capital. For example compare and contrast the following:

Access wealth stored in the equity of your home by means of a HELOC or HELOAN.

Vs.

Access wealth by means of a Bitcoin backed loan.

As someone who has done both, there truly is no comparison. ||| You buy Bitcoin. 

You borrow against it. 

You die. 

And that’s just one of the usecases."

I agree with you, OP. ||| My thoughts are my lessons learned over the years..

Don’t leverage

Stocks are shitcoins (not that there isn’t good stocks, I still own index funds) my point is trying to pick stocks is as risky as trying to pick shitcoins. So VOO and Bitcoin , wake up rich one day.

Keep cash reserves, even if they are losing value to inflation. Nothing crazy, but enough to get you buy for 6 months if you had $0 income. I’m flexible on this one, but always feel better when I have 6 months in the bank. 

Never sell your stack or you’re going to just be buying it back later for more, or trying to cope with missing out.

Macro economy will be tanking some day, I don’t make my moves based on it for Bitcoin. I’ll be damned if I sell and watch it keep rocketing. I did however learn to not leverage. And definitely don’t leverage trying to pick stocks. And definitely don’t continue buying shitty inflated companies stocks on leverage as they tank. 

Buy bitcoin, sell dollars. If it tanks, buy more. If you don’t have money, try to go make some ||| Stopped reading after financial professional here ||| Mmmm the USA is the whole world 🙄 ||| Bitcoin moves with the stock market.

When market tanks, everything tanks.. Bitcoin tank with stock market.

Bitcoin goes back up with market because the fed prints money and lower interest rate to pump the stock market back up.

The economy is never allowed to heal organically.

That is the reason why you hold BTC.

Market at record valuation due to excess cash in market that also goes to BTC."

Anyway, welcome abroad. We all have been where you're at right now. Read/bookmark this guide and make sure to learn along your journey. 

Congrats on the move, it's never too late, [despite new people thinking otherwise](https://old.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/rskpuf/i_have_only_600_bitcoinsi_missed_the_bus/). ONLY INVEST MONEY YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE. 

Invest in your knowledge, learn about Bitcoin as much as you can. The Bitcoin Standard book is a must read. So is Broken Money book. Get them and READ them both, please. 

Also, **don't reply any DMs**, emails, private messages on other social media, promising to buy Bitcoin from them or get rich quick by investing into some website. They all are scammers. Even the hot Asian chick, he's a scammer too. 

**Price wise, nobody knows what the price will be tomorrow, next week or at the end of the year.** 

**Try ""Bitcoin ONLY"" strategy for at least the first 210,000 block cycle**, you'll sleep much better. Newcomers lose so much money, holding garbage tokens just because someone on YT told them to. If you don't like losing money in [failed coins](https://www.coingecko.com/research/publications/how-many-cryptocurrencies-failed), avoid. 

Going DCA is probably the best approach, IMHO. 
Bitcoin to me, is a savings account. If I have some spare cash, I exchange it for sats. Once a week works best for me, but I'm getting paid weekly. If there's a 10% drop in the price since my last buy, I usually double my buy. This [DCA calculator](https://dca.bitnob.com/) might help to decide what will work best for you. In a few years, even $10 dollars a month can make a massive difference. This [DCA blog](https://er-bybitcoin.com/) is pretty interesting too and compares buying bitcoin VS stocks. 

Now, don't buy some fake bitcoin at a spot ETF place or similar, **get the real thing** that you can withdraw anytime you want. Register at a proper exchange and buy real Bitcoin. Any of these will do [https://bitcoin-only.com/get-bitcoin](https://bitcoin-only.com/get-bitcoin) 

Install (or buy - in case you're getting Bitcoin in Thousands of $) one or more of these wallets.

**A few good wallet choices:**

[https://blockstream.com/green/](https://blockstream.com/green/) \- Top Security Features, Open Source and Non-Custodial

[https://bluewallet.io](https://bluewallet.io/) \- excellent, easy to use wallet, Open Source and Non-Custodial 

[https://www.sparrowwallet.com](https://www.sparrowwallet.com) - top desktop wallet 

[https://electrum.org](https://electrum.org/) \- Solid choice, Open Source and Non-Custodial, one of the oldest and most trusted Bitcoin Wallets. I prefer the desktop version but it works on mobile too.

**Lightning wallets** to consider (cheaper and faster transactions, great for small amounts):

[https://phoenix.acinq.co/](https://phoenix.acinq.co/) \- Phoenix - very good wallet, uses Tor for extra privacy, easy for anyone new 

[https://blixtwallet.github.io/](https://blixtwallet.github.io/) \- Blixt - great UI, fast and clean 

[https://zeusln.com/](https://zeusln.com/) Zeus - impressive wallet with many features, can even generate Nostr keys

[https://breez.technology](https://breez.technology/) \- Breez - excellent POS for small business owners as well as integrated Bitrefill 

Note: Breez does also a hybrid liquid/LN wallet called Misty Breez - the sats being on liquid means no need for channels although the payments take a few extra seconds. You'll also can get a free customable LN address. 

While talking about hybrid wallets, there's also Aqua Wallet although not IMHO as good as Misty Breez.

There are also custodial LN wallet but I would honestly avoid using them because you have to trust the wallet operator not to steal your money. Their only advantage is that they are incredibly easy to use, although it might cost you big one day.


**Hardware Wallets** (to store larger amounts):

[Trezor](https://trezor.io/) \- Easy to use, no matter how new in Bitcoin you're. Use the Bitcoin only firmware as it's safer than a multi coin software. 

[ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/) - air gapped, Bitcoin only, has advanced features but a new user will do fine with one of the great tutorials available.

[BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/bitcoin-only/) - another great little device, opt for the more secure Bitcoin ONLY version (less coins = less code = less chance for a hidden bug or a backdoor) 

[Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade) - air gapped, fully open source, Bitcoin only, great features. There's a newer version called Jade Plus, it has much better camera and overall is a better, although a bit more expensive, option. 

You can even [build it on your own](https://github.com/Blockstream/jade/), if you feel adventurous.  

[Seedsigner](https://github.com/SeedSigner/seedsigner) - another DIY, fully open source, air gapped, Bitcoin only hardware wallet, not for you if you're just starting up but something to consider later.

[Krux wallet](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/) - one more DIY hardware device, I love this one for many reasons. Similar to Seedsigner, it's fully open source, air gapped, Bitcoin only hardware wallet, that is not for you right now if you're just starting up, but something to consider at a later stage and/or to up the security of your bitcoin. 


There's also Ledger, but I wouldn't recommend it as it's not fully open source, keep and already leaked customers' details, recently said they're capable of sending customers' keys out just with a firmware update, etc. **Stay away**, save yourself a headache in the future. 

Whatever wallet you'll decide to buy, purchase DIRECTLY from the manufacturer, no eBay, no Amazon. 

Make sure the device is NOT preset, and you will generate your own seed words. Write them down on any piece of paper as well as the receiving address. Now wipe the wallet and generate a new wallet. If the seed words are different from the first set, you're safe to use it. 

Find an option to set a passphrase and use it. This will boost the security to another level. Never store the seed words and passphrase together. Use a different medium if possible. If somebody finds both, they'll be able to steal your coin. 

This little device will hold the keys to your money, that's the reason why you have to be a bit more careful. Also, no worries, if it breaks, you can replace it - as long as you keep your seed words and passphrase(s) safe.

If just nervous, it's really really nothing to worry about. Your fee doesn't seem to be that low (although it's better to quote your fee rate in sat/vbyte, not in sats or $ amounts). The weekends are also generally a period of very low transactional activity, where lower fee rates clear periodically.

I think they have a calculator that will get  you close. Just keep in mind, these are ""snapshot"" estimates. 

This is anecdotal but I mined with physical miners back in 2017-2021 in my own datacenter. In 2017 alone, mining difficulty increased 5X. In 2018 it was 2X. 

Basically your miners will produce less and less as difficulty increases. Just be ready for that. Good luck! ||| Not a miner, but why not look at historical data for hashrate? 

On a side note, I doubt it'll be better than just buying. If you use a hosted service, you are likely to get scammed, if you don't you will have a hard time finding power at a competitive rate. Home mining can be done KYC free, so it might still make sense for some people,  even if you lose a little. Using the heat could also offer an edge. 

I don't know if hosted mining can be done KYC free. I feel like the paper trail would be an issue, but so would home mining through a pool, so maybe it's not an issue.

Anyway, good luck. Love the idea of mining, but it just doesn't seem like it can easily be done at a profit anymore. Hope I'm wrong. ||| Looking at hashrate alone says it’s a likely a losing game, but transaction costs paid to miners also matter. If mania returns rewards could go up. From KYC POV, being hosted is also KYC free to a new cold wallet. Converting to fiat at a later date without KYC becomes the issue.IMO better to stay within laws from the start and not lose ALL gains to paying fines trying to evade tax. 

I’ve probably paid too much for miners, but I’m still interested in feedback from miners. I’m not all in on mining. At worst I expect I will get the fiat equivalent of my miner purchase price back in sats.Plus a profit, who knows.  In the end, BTC is a gamble, mining just changes the odds. My hosting site charges US 5.9c per kWh, so much cheaper than home mining for most people. Scam, who knows? I’ve received 2 monthly payments. They’ve been operating 5 years. Time will tell."

bc1 is the prefix of Bech32 addresses, which are used for P2WPKH, P2WSH, and P2TR transaction outputs.

Descriptor wallets are a type of wallet used in Bitcoin Core and other software, which uses output descriptors to compute addresses from its keys. It can be used for any output/address type, including bc1 addresses, but also base58 addresses (like P2PKH and P2SH).

I would not recommend using P2SH or P2PKH addresses anymore, they are more expensive to use, and less secure than more modern types."

Anyway, welcome abroad. We all have been where you're at right now. Read/bookmark this guide and make sure to learn along your journey. 

Congrats on the move, it's never too late, [despite new people thinking otherwise](https://old.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/rskpuf/i_have_only_600_bitcoinsi_missed_the_bus/). ONLY INVEST MONEY YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE. 

Invest in your knowledge, learn about Bitcoin as much as you can. The Bitcoin Standard book is a must read. So is Broken Money book. Get them and READ them both, please. 

Also, **don't reply any DMs**, emails, private messages on other social media, promising to buy Bitcoin from them or get rich quick by investing into some website. They all are scammers. Even the hot Asian chick, he's a scammer too. 

**Price wise, nobody knows what the price will be tomorrow, next week or at the end of the year.** 

**Try ""Bitcoin ONLY"" strategy for at least the first 210,000 block cycle**, you'll sleep much better. Newcomers lose so much money, holding garbage tokens just because someone on YT told them to. If you don't like losing money in [failed coins](https://www.coingecko.com/research/publications/how-many-cryptocurrencies-failed), avoid. 

Going DCA is probably the best approach, IMHO. 
Bitcoin to me, is a savings account. If I have some spare cash, I exchange it for sats. Once a week works best for me, but I'm getting paid weekly. If there's a 10% drop in the price since my last buy, I usually double my buy. This [DCA calculator](https://dca.bitnob.com/) might help to decide what will work best for you. In a few years, even $10 dollars a month can make a massive difference. This [DCA blog](https://er-bybitcoin.com/) is pretty interesting too and compares buying bitcoin VS stocks. 

Now, don't buy some fake bitcoin at a spot ETF place or similar, **get the real thing** that you can withdraw anytime you want. Register at a proper exchange and buy real Bitcoin. Any of these will do [https://bitcoin-only.com/get-bitcoin](https://bitcoin-only.com/get-bitcoin) 

Install (or buy - in case you're getting Bitcoin in Thousands of $) one or more of these wallets.

**A few good wallet choices:**

[https://blockstream.com/green/](https://blockstream.com/green/) \- Top Security Features, Open Source and Non-Custodial

[https://bluewallet.io](https://bluewallet.io/) \- excellent, easy to use wallet, Open Source and Non-Custodial 

[https://www.sparrowwallet.com](https://www.sparrowwallet.com) - top desktop wallet 

[https://electrum.org](https://electrum.org/) \- Solid choice, Open Source and Non-Custodial, one of the oldest and most trusted Bitcoin Wallets. I prefer the desktop version but it works on mobile too.

**Lightning wallets** to consider (cheaper and faster transactions, great for small amounts):

[https://phoenix.acinq.co/](https://phoenix.acinq.co/) \- Phoenix - very good wallet, uses Tor for extra privacy, easy for anyone new 

[https://blixtwallet.github.io/](https://blixtwallet.github.io/) \- Blixt - great UI, fast and clean 

[https://zeusln.com/](https://zeusln.com/) Zeus - impressive wallet with many features, can even generate Nostr keys

[https://breez.technology](https://breez.technology/) \- Breez - excellent POS for small business owners as well as integrated Bitrefill 

Note: Breez does also a hybrid liquid/LN wallet called Misty Breez - the sats being on liquid means no need for channels although the payments take a few extra seconds. You'll also can get a free customable LN address. 

While talking about hybrid wallets, there's also Aqua Wallet although not IMHO as good as Misty Breez.

There are also custodial LN wallet but I would honestly avoid using them because you have to trust the wallet operator not to steal your money. Their only advantage is that they are incredibly easy to use, although it might cost you big one day.


**Hardware Wallets** (to store larger amounts):

[Trezor](https://trezor.io/) \- Easy to use, no matter how new in Bitcoin you're. Use the Bitcoin only firmware as it's safer than a multi coin software. 

[ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/) - air gapped, Bitcoin only, has advanced features but a new user will do fine with one of the great tutorials available.

[BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/bitcoin-only/) - another great little device, opt for the more secure Bitcoin ONLY version (less coins = less code = less chance for a hidden bug or a backdoor) 

[Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade) - air gapped, fully open source, Bitcoin only, great features. There's a newer version called Jade Plus, it has much better camera and overall is a better, although a bit more expensive, option. 

You can even [build it on your own](https://github.com/Blockstream/jade/), if you feel adventurous.  

[Seedsigner](https://github.com/SeedSigner/seedsigner) - another DIY, fully open source, air gapped, Bitcoin only hardware wallet, not for you if you're just starting up but something to consider later.

[Krux wallet](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/) - one more DIY hardware device, I love this one for many reasons. Similar to Seedsigner, it's fully open source, air gapped, Bitcoin only hardware wallet, that is not for you right now if you're just starting up, but something to consider at a later stage and/or to up the security of your bitcoin. 


There's also Ledger, but I wouldn't recommend it as it's not fully open source, keep and already leaked customers' details, recently said they're capable of sending customers' keys out just with a firmware update, etc. **Stay away**, save yourself a headache in the future. 

Whatever wallet you'll decide to buy, purchase DIRECTLY from the manufacturer, no eBay, no Amazon. 

Make sure the device is NOT preset, and you will generate your own seed words. Write them down on any piece of paper as well as the receiving address. Now wipe the wallet and generate a new wallet. If the seed words are different from the first set, you're safe to use it. 

Find an option to set a passphrase and use it. This will boost the security to another level. Never store the seed words and passphrase together. Use a different medium if possible. If somebody finds both, they'll be able to steal your coin. 

This little device will hold the keys to your money, that's the reason why you have to be a bit more careful. Also, no worries, if it breaks, you can replace it - as long as you keep your seed words and passphrase(s) safe.

Obviously the actual number will vary depending on the person.

When you leave it on Coinbase, you are taking the risk that Coinbase might go out of business, get hacked, or someday not allow you to withdraw.  These have already happened many times with various other exchanges, and the risk is real.  Exchanges always seem rock-solid, until the day that they don't.

When it's in cold storage, you have a different set of risks.  You could lose your keys, or forget how to use them, or be forced to hand them over.  You assume full responsibility, and no one will be able to save you if you mess it up.  Being your own bank requires study and understanding.  Not everyone is cut out for it, and there's nothing wrong with leaving your coins on Coinbase if you feel that the risks of self-custody are greater than Coinbase's counter-party risks. ||| I think coinbase is gtg from what ive seen but the risk of exchanges is that even if they are insured and responsible with your money and one of the many unlikely but possible things happens that causes user funds to disappear, it could take years to get your funds back, and it will likely be the fiat notional value at the time of the incident.


This means that if it takes 4 years to get your money from the exchange and your btc were to have tripled in value in that time (for example) you will only get dollars back at the original 1x value. And that's a generous outcome.


I think all those saying that exchanges are not a risk are forgetting the very recent history of exchanges.


Maybe initially having most on exchange and some in a wallet would help you hedge the risks of either. if you get more comfortable over time in cold storage you can always move more into it. 


I would buy a bitcoin only cold storage wallet (coldcard, trezor are recommended) and learn how to use it safely. Add a small amount to it and get some confidence in it. It's not as daunting as it sounds. Its an hour or 2 out of your day to figure it out. Worth it when you consider your money is hundreds or thousands of hours worth time worked that you are saving.


Make sure you learn about safely backing up your 12 words (never type it in anywhere but your hardware wallet, etc), and reconstituting your wallet if you ever needed to get a new one. Just check out BTC Sessions on YouTube. They're a great resource.  ||| If losing your coins on an exchange would cost you more than a few weeks of earnings to replace them, you need a non-custodial wallet (software or hardware).

If losing your coins on a software wallet would cost you more than a few months of earnings to replace them, you need a hardware wallet.

If losing your coins on a hardware wallet would cost you more than a few years of earnings to replace them, you need a multisig wallet. ||| Divide 15 million Bitcoin by 8 billion people, 400 million companies, 250 governments, and you’ll start to understand the magnitude of things.

I use 15 million because it’s likely ~25% of the supply is lost forever from the early days and people messing up their wallets. ||| To me: small amount would be the amount so small that I couldn’t be bothered to buy a dedicated hardware wallet ($150-ish) to safekeep it. 

If it’s bigger than that, well, then spend $150 and get a good hardware wallet to safekeep it. 

Personally that threshold is around $3k maybe? $150 to protect anything above $3k seems fair."

You'll need to spend about $80,000-$100,000 in electricity + thousands for bitmain antminer (look it up) hardware to mine ""a single bitcoin."" Bitcoin mining is a competitive industrial scale business. For an individual it will be like drilling for oil with a spoon. If you want bitcoin just buy it. ||| You can't mine a single bitcoin, you can only mine a single block. ||| To mine, you’re going to need one or more ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) miners. This can be anything from a little dedicated USB stick miner (e.g. bitaxe) all the way up to the most cutting edge antminers. Miners are rated in hashes per second, so you’ll see ratings like GH/s (gigahash - a billion hashes/sec), TH/s (terrahash - 1000x more), PH/s (petahash - another 1000x), etc.

Once you have your machine(s), you need to decide how you’re going to operate them. The two basic choices are solo or pooled. Solo means you’re betting the computer power you against the compute power of the entire Bitcoin mining network in a race to see who solves the next block first. If you win, you get the whole block reward(currently 3.5 bit) plus transaction fees. If you run pooled, then your compute power is collectively pooled with many others (increasing the odds of a block reward) and you’re rewarded whatever percentage your compute is of the total each time the pool is rewarded a block.

In either scenario, more compute is better. The real issue is that these days, unless you’ve got really cheap energy, it’s practically impossible to make a profit mining. Some of us run miners as hobbyists, but the general consensus is use your money to buy bit. ||| Ask ChatGPT to give you step-by-step instructions. ||| Use $120K to buy the equipment, set it up, let it run for a few months until it's no longer profitable, then realize you could've just bought a coin."

But I know Strike does bitcoin collateralized loans now. So does Ledn, Salt, Coinbase.  If you do it, keep your loan to value ratio reasonable, so you can make it through a downturn without liquidation (that's my 2 cents).

There are a couple of recent podcasts with the CEOs of Strike (Jack Mallers) and the company Salt (which I think has some type of ""no liquidation"" bitcoin loan) that might be worth checking out as options.

I personally haven't done any bitcoin backed loans to leverage more bitcoin, as I generally don't like to use debt to invest from a risk tolerance standpoint. But I have used some home equity, which doesn't carry the risk of liquidation that a bitcoin backed loan does. ||| [deleted] ||| Literally just buy and hold BTC. That's it, no need to fuck around with loans or margin.

If you want to play around, here's a copypaste of my comment posted elsewhere;

>I pay for everything using credit cards and BTC backed loans. I pay off the CC balance in full as soon as my monthly pay comes in to avoid interest charges. The rest goes straight into more BTC DCA that's then sent to cold storage. Outside of my emergency fund, I have no cash anymore.

>Some funds are used to purchase additional STRK shares, generating income. I experimented with MSTY but it's not as good for this purpose. STRK offers downside protection with some upside potential and steady income that repays BTC loans and the remainder is reinvested.

>Liquadation risk is non-existent as I have stable employment and only a small portion of my stack is used as collateral.

>After a few years of learning, nothing else makes sense to me anymore. I do not own any depreciating assets apart from my car or really anything that'd be taking money out of my pocket. I sold my house pre-covid and fully intend to rent for the rest of my life. The freedom this way of life provides is unbeatable and my NW continues skyrocketing while I travel the world.

1nw59bu;It’s fiat that’s falling;ignominiousDog;396;28;1759415145.0;https://i.redd.it/tpaby7djkpsf1.jpeg;"But it's actually both: BTC going up and fiat going down. 

Obviously they're printing money which dilutes fiat which drives its value down. 

But they're not printing money at a rate of 20% - 30% per year. 

I love this post! Just wanted to point out that even without fiat going down, bitcoin is rising in value because demand is rising wall supply stays relatively flat. ||| Interesting thing to think about is this:

When GDP/productivity rises, in a fixed money supply environment, prices fall and purchase power increases.

The government takes this purchase power and converts it into inflation, taking that for themselves in the form of printed monetary supply. This is only true for fiat currency.

Not only does bitcoin capture inflationary increases, it also captures global/national gdp and productivity growth since it does have fixed supply. Robotics, AI, and other productivity gains in energy or other sectors will directly impact the value and purchase power of bitcoin since it is fixed supply.

Because of the above fact, we also have another thing which increases BTC, which is adoption. More and more individuals and institutions will see the rate of increase in bitcoin and increase demand, therefore raising the price.

Additionally, bitcoin will then be used to further extend yield and credit instruments like Saylor is doing with Strategy, which will increase demand even further.

BTC will go up forever. ||| No.  Bitcoin is still rising because adoption and demand has increased.  That will continue for a while, and once that is largely done we will see how good an inflation hedge it is vs inflated currencies.  Bitcoin now is driven by supply/demand, not fiat devaluation. ||| The Dollar is the Reserve Currency for the World. What are other countries going to do? There is no other option that wouldn't cause a global financial disaster but to keep the Dollar as status quo.  Short term its OK to have it lose some value. Bitcoin is a great store of wealth and maybe one day a medium of exchange. ||| Your assets (House, Gold/Silver, Crypto...) and your cost of living (groceries, utility bills...) isn't really more expensive or gained value as much as the purchasing power of fiat currency simply went down and doesn't buy as much as it used which makes things appear to cost more and have more value. ...but the government will still tax you on your 'gains' when you go to sell your assets. Does the government allow you to claim a loss when you spend fiat currency that you had saved that lost purchasing power due to inflating the money supply? All the fiat sitting in your bank account is just losing purchasing power every single year through inflation. The purchasing power of fiat is only going in one direction...downwards."

They lend you 995K. You go long with a 1M position. As long as the position is open, they charge you interest on the loan. 


Market goes up and you close the position. Fantastic, you get to keep the profits on the entire movement. They charge you some fees, give you what's left as well as your original 5K, and take back the 995K.


Market goes down by 0.5% from opening (for Bitcoin right now, that's a $600 dip)? The position is automatically closed, they use your 5K to cover the loss, take back their 995K. They haven't lost anything, you've lost everything. You were just liquidated. ||| They just lend you the BTC for the trade. They pocket the fee whether you win or lose. ||| 200x leverage, most people lose, that's how. ||| Leverage providers swap the higher risk movement risk for lower risk maintenance fees. They do that by lending and recalling an asset at a fixed fiat value and charging you a maintenance fee allowing you to expose yourself to the movement risk for a smaller upfront cost. 

In this scenario where you purchased 5k of an asset, you paid a maintenance fee for the privilege. The original 5k of assets goes back to the leverage provider as well as the fee. You get to keep the upside from the market movement.

They haven’t lost any fiat money, merely given up the upside in exchange for a virtually guaranteed smaller return. 

The liquidation price is set so there is almost always enough money to pay back the original asset cost. So even when the market moves in the wrong direction and you get liquidated they still make money (in fiat). ||| In simple terms, the broker is not the other end of your trade. They are just matching you with someone else on the opposite end. The broker makes money providing their infrastructure for the trade and taking fees for it."

On any exchange there are buyers and sellers.

e.g. suppose the order book looked like this:

* User A has a buy order at 115,600
* User B has a buy order at 116,600
* User C has a sell order at 118,600
* User D has a sell order at 119,600

What is the ""current price"" on the exchange? 

* The highest buy price (116,600)? 
* The lowest sell price (118,600)?
* The buy/sell midpoint (117,600)?
* The ""latest trade"" price?

Clearly, there is no single price.

If you place a *market* sell order, you'll typically get the current highest buy price.

If you place a *market* buy order, you'll typically get the current lowest sell price.

If you place a *limit* order, your order will sit in the order book until your target price is met. It won't execute *immediately* (or possibly at all), but if/when the order goes through, you'll get the price you wanted.

If you place a *market* order, it'll execute *immediately* but you may not get the price you wanted. You're paying extra for the convenience of an instant sell. ||| You paid .85% on your sell order. So if you sold $320 worth of bitcoin you paid a fee of $2.72 for the sell order."

No course needed. 

Let's start with how you want to hold your bitcoins. Most around here would encourage self custody but buying shares of an ETF is also viable.

Which suits you? ||| Open an account on a reputable exchange. Fund it. Do some crypto buys and sells. Learn how transfer to cold storage. Buy Bitcoin. Hodl. ||| You don’t need a course. You can buy pure bitcoin on one of the reputable exchanges (Kraken, Strike, River, Gemini; there are many others). Upload ID and a means of payment (bank account #, PayPal, wire, other) and buy some. It’s that simple.

Eventually learn how to put the bitcoin in cold storage (Trezor has many easy to understand YouTube’s) but you don’t need to do that today. Think about it when you get to 0.01 bitcoin ($1,000 US) or higher. 

If you really want to hit the easy button, buy an ETF through Fidelity (FBTC) or Blackrock (iBIT). In USA these can be either in retirement accounts or not (check if available in Canada or if there is a Canadian version). It’s not the purest way of doing it, but you’ll see the same gains bitcoin will (minus a tiny fee).

Read one of these two books so you know why bitcoin is a smart investment and not what you always assumed it was: 

-The Bitcoin Standard (Ammous) or 

-Broken Money (Alden).

Both are stone cold classics. You need to know more than simply, “Number goes up.” 

Listen to podcasts involving people like Saifedean Ammous, Lyn Alden, Lawrence Lepard, Michael Saylor.

Avoid anything having to do with sh¡tcoins (any crypto currency other than bitcoin, which are all designed and controlled by a person or small group to make them rich; only bitcoin was given to us for free and is controlled by no single person or group of investors).

Start with very small amounts until you feel more comfortable with what you’re doing. ||| Step 1: buy

Step 2: hodl 

You’re now a certified bitcoin investor. Go forth and prosper. ||| It is best to buy BTC and save for the long term, never sell your BTC and you will have many advantages later."

2nd year the market corrects for the new scarcity of Bitcoins, price goes up really fast esp end of year (**we are here**)

3rd year, the market overcorrected, now it's time for a bear. Price goes down, but still above 1st year.

4th year, the market overcorrected on the way down, now it will go slightly up, but not as much as in year 2.

5th year new halving.

NOTE: I, and many others, believer that we are out of this wishy washy 4 year cycle. Price will steadily grind upwards for a long time. This is to be confirmed next year as the expected bear market will somehow not come. ||| New coin reward is reduced in half every 4 years. This coincided with price increases, before, during, or after this halving. While the halvings are guaranteed by design, the price action is not. The so called 4 year price cycle is an observed phenomenon up until now but it may end at any time, or has ended already. ||| As per AI

Imagine Bitcoin is like a giant playground slide.

	1.	The Climb (Halving) – Every four years, the slide gets taller because fewer new Bitcoins are made. This makes kids (investors) more excited to climb it.

	2.	The Big Whoosh (Bull Run) – When the slide is new and tall, lots of kids want to go down. Everyone’s yelling “Wheee!” and prices shoot up really fast.

	3.	The Crash (Bear Market) – But then too many kids go at once, the line gets shorter, and some kids get scared. Prices fall, and it feels like the fun is over.

	4.	The Rest (Accumulation) – The playground quiets down. Fewer kids are playing. The slide is still there, and slowly kids start lining up again because they know another climb is coming.

Then… a new halving happens (the slide grows taller again), and the whole game starts over.

⸻

So Bitcoin’s cycle is kind of like climb, whoosh, crash, rest… repeat. ||| Listen up sport, the world is a crazy random place and adults feel more comfortable if they think there's a pattern that they understand. They'll convince themselves that they have some understanding of a market that's ultimately way outside of their control or reasoning. Sometimes the line goes up, sometimes it goes down, people look back and see patterns in those ups and downs and then pretend that tells them something about the future so they can sleep at night. 

TLDR just keep DCA ||| year 4: new all time high, good times. Peak at the end of the year.  
year 1: Crash. We might see a bottom at the end of the year. Often above the last cycles high (not the case in 2023)  
year 2: bottom at the start of the year, if not found in previous year. We recover a bit, we might end up halfway between the top and the bottom.  
year 3: we continue to recover, and in December we hit the previous cycles all time high. 

The order might seem a bid odd, but we are in year 4 right now, so I've chosen to start with it. I think the cycles end with an all time high, and the bear is the beginning of the new cycle. 

The halving might play a role in the cycle, but I don't actually think that's the case.

Might be overly specific, but that's sort of the events I've been expecting. I don't trade it, but I feel it has been surprisingly accurate. I think this cycle might be different because of the price action this year. It can still change, but If we don't see a blow off top, I don't expect a big drop. We might just have a period of low volatility, who knows. Maybe we'll see a global financial crisis that'll put Bitcoin on ice for some time."

Get a proper hardware wallet, or use a dedicated offline device.

Even a mobile wallet on your phone is generally more safe than keeping it on an online PC due to the smaller attack surface. ||| Hi I have a few paper wallets. I made 2 copies of the private key and tucked them away.


Not sure how hardware is better, when hardware can be destroyed, go missing, and break.


I mean, it works, so I haven't looked into hardware wallets.


Dont you need the passphrase,  so isnt it the same as a paper wallet kinda?


Im dumb so I stick with what I know works.


Fire proof safes aren't fire proof. You gotta buy a thick book and stick it in there so it cant burn. Not that fire is common. ||| I really think buying a trezor is the best thing to do. The device itself is locked with a pincode. If you lose it you can just get another one because all your bitcoin is stored in the seed phrase. You can also make a passphrase thats anything you want that works as the 13th or 25th word in your seed phrase so even if they have your seed phrase they would need the passphrase too. They are $50-$100 on amazon. The trezor safe 3 is what I have. I literally just sent my bitcoin from coinbase straight to my trezor wallet with the receive/send codes. ||| I have about CA$8,000 worth of coin at Wealthsimple in Canada. I think it secure there. If they get hacked, then I think .gov and insurance companies can help them pay back clients. I should see if my house insurance covers it as theft. Do any insurance companies cover for wallet hacks? ||| You have a PC, are into gaming, and you like to think you’re usually pretty safe?  Hoping your stash isn’t more than a few hundred bucks.

Anyway, if it is, get a decent hardware wallet, and a metal device that gets all A’s for fire, corrosion, and physical crushing.  I use Black Seed Ink, but plenty of good ones to choose from.  On the wallet, create a new seed, then reset  it and create another new seed (and 2 more times for good measure).  Reset and create a new seed - physically cover any cameras, including your pretty safe PC, and your phones.  Don’t talk to yourself while you are working since you can’t possibly physically block all of the microphones around you.  Write down the seed on a piece of paper, and generate a receive address.  Now reset the wallet and set it up with the seed you wrote down.  Make sure it generates the same receive address.  Now record the seed from paper onto your metal storage, and reset the wallet and reload the seed reading your metal version.  Make sure it generates the same receive address.  Now shred the paper and/or burn it thoroughly (crushing any ashes).  Send $50 worth of bitcoin to that receive address and make sure it gets there.  Get a safe deposit box at a good bank, and put your seed in there.  Now generate a new receive address and send it $2000.  Wait 2-3 months and make sure no one steals it.  Now send it the rest of your stash in chunks of $5,000, each to a newly generated receive address, until your stash is moved.  Now generate one final receive address, which you can use to send more coin to in the future, and reset the cold wallet.  Either create a new account for “working” bitcoin (as opposed to investment coin), or just keep on the shelf for the time you decide you want to tap into your coin (in which case you take it into the vault room with a visual cloak and flashlight, and load your keys into it right there under the cloak before leaving your seed where it is).

You feel safer yet?  In my case, I made two metal copies, and stored one in a nearby bank safe deposit box and one in a commercial secure vault in another country I visit occasionally.  I’m not sure I feel completely safe, but I’m perhaps a little paranoid.  Just never know if I’m paranoid enough!  At any rate, I sleep pretty well at night."

Absolutely nothing. Bitcoin has, and will continue to be, used for illegal things at the margin.


At the moment, you are perhaps in agreement with the powers that be on everything that should be illegal, but what if someday something that you believe is a legitimate use of money becomes illegal?


Bitcoin removes legal punishment from the arena of money and keeps it where it should be, the courts (for all their flaws). Look into civil forfeiture (if you have that in your jurisdiction). You don't even have to be found guilty of anything, they can just take your shit. ||| do you go blank when people trade drugs, other humans etc with regular currency?

1nudlxa;Emergency Fund;PursuingTrueFreedom;20;137;1759239885.0;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1nudlxa/emergency_fund/;"Emergency funds are like having insurance. You set aside/pay for something you hope you’ll never need. If you don’t think tragedy can hit you out of the blue, you’re either young, naïve, or both. It happens to people all the time.

I keep 6 months in a very stable, liquid fund. Bitcoin is extremely volatile. It makes zero sense to use something that can drop 50% or more as an emergency fund — emphasis on emergency.

But hey, you do you. ||| My view on it is as follows:

What emergency are we talking about?  

House Fire - total loss.  Have my BTC outside of my house, credit cards for short term, cash at bank for medium.  We are good.

Car accident - see above

Medical emergency - see above

Job loss - add unemployment, see above. 


The honest truth is that I can't conceive of an emergency that requires immediate liquidation of an emergency fund. Thus, I'm content to use my BTC as my emergency fund and take from in a reverse DCA method. ||| Amount depends on your cost of living.  Usually keep minimum 3 months of average cost of living in something liquid that you can easily cash out. ||| I have a few different layers on my emergency fund:

\- 1 month in checking (usually try to keep it to 0.5 months)

\- 2 months in JAAA in a brokerage account (VTIP is fine too)

\- 2-4 months in gold/silver ETFs (will eventually move that to physical, but easily liquidated if needed)

\- 6 months in physical gold/silver (harder to liquidate quickly)

Beyond this is I have a few years worth of funds in Bitcoin and BTGD, but I'm not sure I would consider that an emergency fund...maybe a SUPER emergency fund. ||| I think emergency fund thinking is way outdated. The market is so liquid it doesn’t matter. And it’s just losing gains. If u need the money just liquidate the investment. It is more likely to be up than down. And if it’s down whatever u take a hit."

As long as Bitcoin's CAGR is higher than the interest rate on the mortgage (which it historically has been), you're better off taking the loan, buying bitcoin, then selling monthly for the payment. 

The amount of bitcoin you'd need to sell over the years should continue decreasing as the value of bitcoim rises, leaving you with much more bitcoin than if you bought the house outright.

You should throw together some spreadsheets that chart out the value of your btc and house over the life of your mortgage (or would be mortgage) that makes some assumptions about the expected increase in value of each asset. Or just ask chatgpt. 

This is effectively purchasing bitcoin with leverage, so take that for what it's worth. Not financial advice. ||| 10% for a home loan?? Hard to believe it ||| Get the loan, Bitcoin should hit $150k by December. Plus if you cash in your BTC you will have to pay taxes which is probably higher than your loan interest rate. ||| 1 seems the best option... If and only if you are able to pay the loan with income. That way you are able to protect your btc in a bear market. Also, use bull periods to aggressively accelerate loan payment. ||| Paying outright is simpler. You don't have to give up 3 months of bank statements and have the bank crawl up your rectum and hit your credit score. The downside is losing on potential gains. Gains that are not guaranteed. But misery getting a mortgage is guaranteed. So pick your battle. Not having monthly payments is also quite nice and what you could be paying for mortgage can be used to buy BTC as you go."

Some of the more popular wallets seem to be ledger and trezor, but there are a ton of options. If you plan to accumulate more, I'd definitely start setting up cold. Learn the basics, seed phrase and what it does. Don't ever store seed on a phone or anywhere digital don't even take photos. Research the ways to store it and the ways to be safe when using the wallet. Always type on the wallet screen itself if that's available, not on cpu because malware can keylog and get your info that way. Just educate on all the scams/malware and things to know to avoid. Always check your send receive address on the screen of the wallet too, this avoids copy/paste malware and other things that could go wrong, from my understanding scanning the qr code is safe for send recieve address. 

Load small amounts before going big, that way you can make sure it gets there correctly before doing a larger send. On your crypto exchange of choice, make sure you have 2fa with authenticator app and the other safe security measures, even consider making an email that's never been associated with any of you throughout your life, just for crypto email and don't use it for other things. You can set up whitelisting on your exchange account, this means you have to verify with the 2fa or other methods to add a send receive address, this is better because if someone were to access your account, they still wouldn't be able to send to themselves without your 2fa. I know you wouldn't be storing on the exchange, but all of this is just security measures against anything that could go wrong. 

I'd get ready to go cold, choose an exchange (look for referral you could get free crypto for some sign ups) set up all correct security on the exchange acct. research wallets, make sure you buy wallet and download software directly from the company not 3rd party or the device could be compromised already.

Research the seed phrase storage methods choose what would work for you, do that first and test recovery on the wallet to make sure it works if you ever needed it.

Test send to the wallet small size to make sure it works properly. Then go cold! 

Maybe I missed some things but hope it's a starting point. Always do your own research too, don't just take my word for it or anyone else. ||| If you're already comfortable using open source Bitcoin wallet apps (Electrum, Sparrow, BlueWallet, Nunchuk etc) and you only intend to hold Bitcoin on this wallet, I'd 100% recommend ColdCard.

Hardware wallets (cold wallets) are physical devices that store private keys offline, protecting assets from online threats. Examples include Ledger Nano X, Trezor Model T, and ELLIPAL Titan 2.0.

• Pros: Maximum security, offline storage, immune to online hacks
• Cons: Cost $50–200+, less convenient for daily use, can be lost or damaged
Software Wallets: Convenience and Accessibility
Software wallets are applications for desktops or mobiles. They balance usability with security, making them ideal for frequent transactions.

• Desktop options: Electrum, Bitcoin Core, Exodus
• Mobile options: BlueWallet, Samourai Wallet, Atomic Wallet
• Pros: Free, user-friendly, frequently updated
• Cons: Vulnerable to malware, depend on device security
Custodial vs Non-Custodial
Custodial wallets (e.g., Coinbase, Binance) are managed by third parties, while non-custodial wallets (e.g., hardware wallets, Trust Wallet) give users full control.

• Custodial pros: Easy to use, support, integrated trading
• Custodial cons: No control over keys, vulnerable to hacks
• Non-custodial pros: Full ownership, privacy, no third-party risk
• Non-custodial cons: User is fully responsible for security
How to Choose the Right Bitcoin Wallet
Choosing depends on your needs:
• High-security needs: Hardware wallets, multi-signature setups, cold storage
• Daily use: Mobile or desktop wallets
• Beginners: Custodial wallets (e.g., Coinbase, Cash App) with gradual transition to non-custodial options ||| The best hardware wallets are Jade, Coldcard, Trezor and Seedsigner.


Ledger, while popular, should be avoided. Proprietary code and sketchy security practices by the company make it a no-no.


The best companion apps (software to add your wallet as watch-only on your pc/phone to view balance and initate transactions) are Sparrow, BlueWallet, and Nunchuk. ||| You can make use of ledger or trezor. Blue wallet also works fine ||| Depends on how much you’re holding. A few grand? You can keep it on a wallet on your phone, like Aqua (I’m sure there will be many other suggestions).

If you’re holding more than that you need to buy a hardware wallet. I like Coldcard. There’s a bit of a learning curve but it’s extremely secure and once you get it, it’s intuitive. 

Lastly, you need to download Sparrow (desktop/laptop only). Sparrow is the software you use to sign the Bitcoin transactions (with the Coldcard).

I know I'm asking a stupid question, but in this sub, I would imagine most people know that. ||| [deleted] ||| I bought $30,000 worth in the spring of 2024 at just under 70000. It tanked all summer until it was announced that Mr. Trump was going to speak in Nashville at the end of July. He spoke on Saturday, July 27/2024. The following Monday, the DoJ moved 29,800 of the US coin hoard between wallets. This was about 13% of their total. The price had made it up to 69351 before that. The FUD caused the price to crash badly. The Dems were still in power then, and there was no transparency. In Nov 2024 the price was back up because of the election. I sold it at just under 99000 and declared capital gains. I had to sell because I didn't trust the custodian, bad Trustpilot comments. I moved the cash to Wealthsimple and bought coin with it. Eventually I sold most of the $80,000 in coin, but converted it to bitcoin RRSP ETFs to save taxes. I still buy coin when I can and hope to build it back up to at least $100,000. My main point is sometimes you can sell, but try and HODL until we make it to Mars at least.

We all have been where you're at right now. Read/bookmark this guide and make sure to learn along your journey. 

Congrats on the move, it's never too late, [despite new people thinking otherwise](https://old.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/rskpuf/i_have_only_600_bitcoinsi_missed_the_bus/). ONLY INVEST MONEY YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE. 

Invest in your knowledge, learn about Bitcoin as much as you can. The Bitcoin Standard book is a must read. So is Broken Money book. Get them and READ them both, please. 

Also, **don't reply any DMs**, emails, private messages on other social media, promising to buy Bitcoin from them or get rich quick by investing into some website. They all are scammers. Even the hot Asian chick, he's a scammer too. 

**Price wise, nobody knows what the price will be tomorrow, next week or at the end of the year.** 

**Try ""Bitcoin ONLY"" strategy for at least the first 210,000 block cycle**, you'll sleep much better. Newcomers lose so much money, holding garbage tokens just because someone on YT told them to. If you don't like losing money in [failed coins](https://www.coingecko.com/research/publications/how-many-cryptocurrencies-failed), avoid. 

Going DCA is probably the best approach, IMHO. 
Bitcoin to me, is a savings account. If I have some spare cash, I exchange it for sats. Once a week works best for me, but I'm getting paid weekly. If there's a 10% drop in the price since my last buy, I usually double my buy. This [DCA calculator](https://dca.bitnob.com/) might help to decide what will work best for you. In a few years, even $10 dollars a month can make a massive difference. This [DCA blog](https://er-bybitcoin.com/) is pretty interesting too and compares buying bitcoin VS stocks. 

Install (or buy - in case you're getting Bitcoin in Thousands of $) one or more of these wallets.

**A few good wallet choices:**

[https://blockstream.com/green/](https://blockstream.com/green/) \- Top Security Features, Open Source and Non-Custodial

[https://bluewallet.io](https://bluewallet.io/) \- excellent, easy to use wallet, Open Source and Non-Custodial 

[https://www.sparrowwallet.com](https://www.sparrowwallet.com) - top desktop wallet 

[https://electrum.org](https://electrum.org/) \- Solid choice, Open Source and Non-Custodial, one of the oldest and most trusted Bitcoin Wallets. I prefer the desktop version but it works on mobile too.

**Lightning wallets** to consider (cheaper and faster transactions, great for small amounts):

[https://phoenix.acinq.co/](https://phoenix.acinq.co/) \- Phoenix - very good wallet, uses Tor for extra privacy, easy for anyone new 

[https://blixtwallet.github.io/](https://blixtwallet.github.io/) \- Blixt - great UI, fast and clean 

[https://zeusln.com/](https://zeusln.com/) Zeus - impressive wallet with many features, can even generate Nostr keys

[https://breez.technology](https://breez.technology/) \- Breez - excellent POS for small business owners as well as integrated Bitrefill 

Note: Breez does also a hybrid liquid/LN wallet called Misty Breez - the sats being on liquid means no need for channels although the payments take a few extra seconds. You'll also can get a free customable LN address. 

While talking about hybrid wallets, there's also Aqua Wallet although not IMHO as good as Misty Breez.

There are also custodial LN wallet but I would honestly avoid using them because you have to trust the wallet operator not to steal your money. Their only advantage is that they are incredibly easy to use, although it might cost you big one day.


**Hardware Wallets** (to store larger amounts):

[Trezor](https://trezor.io/) \- Easy to use, no matter how new in Bitcoin you're. Use the Bitcoin only firmware as it's safer than a multi coin software. 

[ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/) - air gapped, Bitcoin only, has advanced features but a new user will do fine with one of the great tutorials available.

[BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/bitcoin-only/) - another great little device, opt for the more secure Bitcoin ONLY version (less coins = less code = less chance for a hidden bug or a backdoor) 

[Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade) - air gapped, fully open source, Bitcoin only, great features. There's a newer version called Jade Plus, it has much better camera and overall is a better, although a bit more expensive, option. 

You can even [build it on your own](https://github.com/Blockstream/jade/), if you feel adventurous.  

[Seedsigner](https://github.com/SeedSigner/seedsigner) - another DIY, fully open source, air gapped, Bitcoin only hardware wallet, not for you if you're just starting up but something to consider later.

[Krux wallet](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/) - one more DIY hardware device, I love this one for many reasons. Similar to Seedsigner, it's fully open source, air gapped, Bitcoin only hardware wallet, that is not for you right now if you're just starting up, but something to consider at a later stage and/or to up the security of your bitcoin. 


There's also Ledger, but I wouldn't recommend it as it's not fully open source, keep and already leaked customers' details, recently said they're capable of sending customers' keys out just with a firmware update, etc. **Stay away**, save yourself a headache in the future. 

Whatever wallet you'll decide to buy, purchase DIRECTLY from the manufacturer, no eBay, no Amazon. 

Make sure the device is NOT preset, and you will generate your own seed words. Write them down on any piece of paper as well as the receiving address. Now wipe the wallet and generate a new wallet. If the seed words are different from the first set, you're safe to use it. 

Find an option to set a passphrase and use it. This will boost the security to another level. Never store the seed words and passphrase together. Use a different medium if possible. If somebody finds both, they'll be able to steal your coin. 

This little device will hold the keys to your money, that's the reason why you have to be a bit more careful. Also, no worries, if it breaks, you can replace it - as long as you keep your seed words and passphrase(s) safe.

Welcome to the rabbit hole and don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions anytime during your Bitcoin journey.

Also, [check the sidebar](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/about) that's filled with lots of great info and if you have any questions, visit r/BitcoinBeginners or r/Bitcoin and look for the answers. ||| Sounds like you have it down. ||| Control your emotions and follow the selected strategy regardless of the market conditions. Even if Bitcoin hits the ground.

Get yourself a hardware wallet or a paper wallet for long-term storage. ||| Just keep buying. You’re literally starting your journey at a cycle top…be prepared for a dump, but just keep buying. Also, get a ledger, move your BTC off the exchange every so often.. ||| I just started too! Aged 21"

Did you get an inheritance or something? The thing about Bitcoin is it will test your emotional resilience. There will be big drops.

Get a hardware wallet, buy a small amount (even just $100 or whatever), do the whole process of getting it on there. Stamp your seed phrase on a metal plate. Get comfortable. Then start buying more. If you feel the passion/energy to keep going even after hitting certain goals (ie 0.1 btc) you are probably good to go. Once you are ready, you won’t be able to stop yourself from hitting that goal, and it will feel great when you do. If you aren’t ready?

If you want broad ecosystem and ease, mainstream options are fine. If you prefer verifiability, look for open-source firmware and reproducible builds. Air-gapped signers reduce USB and BLE surfaces, while secure elements harden physical extraction. For high value, consider 2-of-3 multisig across different vendors to avoid a single implementation bug taking you out. Regardless of device, the process matters most: never digitize seeds, test a restore with trivial funds, and keep backups in separate locations. Add a passphrase only if you can manage it for years. Think supply-chain too, buy direct and inspect, then lock in a routine you can execute under stress. ||| Some good hardware wallet options are the [Coldcard Q](https://coldcard.com/q), [BitBox02 Bitcoin-only edition](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/bitcoin-only/), [Blockstream Jade Plus](https://store.blockstream.com/products/jade-plus?variant=49701334188320), [Trezor Safe 5 Bitcoin-only](https://trezor.io/trezor-safe-5-bitcoin-only), and [Foundation Passport Core](https://foundation.xyz/passport-core/). These five hardware wallets are all good hardware wallets that have publicly available source code that can be reviewed.

There are also older & cheaper versions of three of these hardware wallets but they are still open source and reliable. They are just less user friendly than the newer & costlier versions. Those older & cheaper versions are the [Coldcard Mk4](https://coldcard.com/mk4), [Trezor Safe 3](https://trezor.io/trezor-safe-3), and [Blockstream Jade Classic](https://store.blockstream.com/products/blockstream-jade-hardware-wallet). ||| picking a cold wallet can feel overwhelming, but you can keep it simple and safe Best Wallet keeps things straightforward while covering the key safety boxes. my flow is basic, use a hardware signer, write the 24 words clearly, no photos, and stash a metal backup offsite. do a tiny send in and out to prove the workflow, then scale up. if you add a passphrase, don’t store it with the seed. i like a watch-only wallet on my phone to see balances without touching keys. buy direct, check seals, and update firmware only from the official app. simple habits, fewer surprises. ||| Coldcard Q"

And the petrodollar is kinda already a thing. The world's economies still run on oil, and overwhelmingly, U.S. dollars are owed to buy and sell oil on the world stage. 

The dollar gets most of it's value because you basically HAVE to acquire dollars if you want to: 

1) invest in the stock market of the largest economy in the world

Personally, I think you should continue to stack. Not because you don't deserve to enjoy your life, but because bitcoin can be an incredible opportunity for you.   
  
If you have $100k and you can put $1k aside a month, that's 1% more bitcoin every month. 12% in a year. That's significant.

If you’re still getting started and not used to the volatility yet, a DCA can be better to ease in and avoid making bad emotional decisions.

The disaster is when you buy bitcoin without a real plan, panic sell a dip, then FOMO rebuy higher. Sounds silly but tons of people do this. ||| I’d do half and then DCA the rest over 6 months or so. ||| lump sum (all at once) = higher expected value, higher variance  

DCA (gradually) = lower variance, lower expected value  

The two main questions you have to ask yourself: can you stomach a drop down 10%, 20%, 30% or something like that the day after you bought? And are you comfortable with holding such a large sum in bitcoin in the first place (meaning, have you got a hardware wallet, have you done a proper backup, did you test your backup, do you know what to do if your device bricks, do you understand what a seed phrase is etc etc).  

If the answer to both question is a yes, then you might consider lump sum. Either way, it doesn't really matter all that much.  

One argument in favour of DCA beyond pure EV is that it gives you a bit of time to get accustomed to bitcoin storage/transactions before jumping in with larger amounts.  

This is all under assumption that you can stomach losing all your money completely and your life will still be fine.

You should understand the situation before predetermining what is ""better"". ||| Why the misleading troll question? ||| As usual in Bitcoin and open source more general, this is a drama with a somewhat long backstory, technical subtleties, and various different drama sub-branches, including personal animosities and fun twists like that.  

So it's not easy to do a clean, objective ELI5 at all, but here's my attempt at it:  

Core has made some tweaks in the client that are more accommodative to today's realities of blocks' content (removing the op_return limit). This has solid engineering arguments in favor (described [here](https://bitcoincore.org/en/2025/06/06/relay-statement/) and [here](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/127895/implications-of-op-return-changes-in-upcoming-bitcoin-core-version-30-0) and [here](https://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/2025/09/26/#selected-qa-from-bitcoin-stack-exchange), as well as in various discussions on GitHub,  the developer [mailinglist](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev) and on [delvingbitcoin](https://delvingbitcoin.org/)).  

Some folks started to argue that instead of solid engineering, this is an attempt to ""bow"" to miners and that users should be able to model what is being mined into blocks by the power of their nodes (their internal mempools). Hence Knots client, basically a copy of Core, which allows users to adjust settings for their local mempool policy (mempool = a collection of unconfirmed transactions). There is a lot of countercritique for that (the Knots client having only one maintainer, the merging process is less transparent; 2nd level effects include benefit for larger miners, further increasing mining centralization; higher loads on filtering nodes, because they need to download filtered transactions twice and so on). Basically, Knots proponents attempt to introduce censorship (however well-meant) to a system, of which the main point is to be censorship resistant. Solving this on the level of individual mempools is essentially impossible, but it does make a nice battle cry.   

So from my view (which is probably not really an ELI5, nor objective, nor complete), there's nothing ""going on with Core"". There are people disagreeing with the update and that's obviously within anyone's rights. I don't think using Knots is a better option, but that's also anyone's right to disagree. It's also anyone's freedom to simply modify the Core client in any way they seem fit without anyone being able to stop them, that's one of the main beautiful parts of bitcoin. ||| Knots is basically just Core with some modifications that enable you to easily change settings.

https://old.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/1nf6ffl/why_choose_knots_over_core/

You should be aware of the development process of Knots and the history of the sole maintainer of Knots: https://blog.lopp.net/knot-a-serious-project/ ||| Knots is a fork of Bitcoin Core focusing on stricter validation rules and advanced features like BIP 69 deterministic transaction ordering.

Note: Breez does also a hybrid liquid/LN wallet called Misty Breez - the sats being on liquid means no need for channels although the payments take a few extra seconds. You'll also can get a free customable LN address. 

While talking about hybrid wallets, there's also Aqua Wallet although not IMHO as good as Misty Breez.

There are also custodial LN wallet but I would honestly avoid using them because you have to trust the wallet operator not to steal your money. Their only advantage is that they are incredibly easy to use, although it might cost you big one day.


**Hardware Wallets** (to store larger amounts):

[Trezor](https://trezor.io/) \- Easy to use, no matter how new in Bitcoin you're. Use the Bitcoin only firmware as it's safer than a multi coin software. 

[ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/) - air gapped, Bitcoin only, has advanced features but a new user will do fine with one of the great tutorials available.

[BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/bitcoin-only/) - another great little device, opt for the more secure Bitcoin ONLY version (less coins = less code = less chance for a hidden bug or a backdoor) 

[Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade) - air gapped, fully open source, Bitcoin only, great features. There's a newer version called Jade Plus, it has much better camera and overall is a better, although a bit more expensive, option. 

You can even [build it on your own](https://github.com/Blockstream/jade/), if you feel adventurous.  

[Seedsigner](https://github.com/SeedSigner/seedsigner) - another DIY, fully open source, air gapped, Bitcoin only hardware wallet, not for you if you're just starting up but something to consider later.

[Krux wallet](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/) - one more DIY hardware device, I love this one for many reasons. Similar to Seedsigner, it's fully open source, air gapped, Bitcoin only hardware wallet, that is not for you right now if you're just starting up, but something to consider at a later stage and/or to up the security of your bitcoin. 


There's also Ledger, but I wouldn't recommend it as it's not fully open source, keep and already leaked customers' details, recently said they're capable of sending customers' keys out just with a firmware update, etc. **Stay away**, save yourself a headache in the future. 

Whatever wallet you'll decide to buy, purchase DIRECTLY from the manufacturer, no eBay, no Amazon. 

Make sure the device is NOT preset, and you will generate your own seed words. Write them down on any piece of paper as well as the receiving address. Now wipe the wallet and generate a new wallet. If the seed words are different from the first set, you're safe to use it. 

Find an option to set a passphrase and use it. This will boost the security to another level. Never store the seed words and passphrase together. Use a different medium if possible. If somebody finds both, they'll be able to steal your coin. 

This little device will hold the keys to your money, that's the reason why you have to be a bit more careful. Also, no worries, if it breaks, you can replace it - as long as you keep your seed words and passphrase(s) safe.

Invest in your knowledge, learn about Bitcoin as much as you can. The Bitcoin Standard book is a must read. So is Broken Money book. Get them and READ them both, please. 

Also, **don't reply any DMs**, emails, private messages on other social media, promising to buy Bitcoin from them or get rich quick by investing into some website. They all are scammers. Even the hot Asian chick, he's a scammer too. 

**Price wise, nobody knows what the price will be tomorrow, next week or at the end of the year.** 

**Try ""Bitcoin ONLY"" strategy for at least the first 210,000 block cycle**, you'll sleep much better. Newcomers lose so much money, holding garbage tokens just because someone on YT told them to. If you don't like losing money in [failed coins](https://www.coingecko.com/research/publications/how-many-cryptocurrencies-failed), avoid. 

Going DCA is probably the best approach, IMHO. 
Bitcoin to me, is a savings account. If I have some spare cash, I exchange it for sats. Once a week works best for me, but I'm getting paid weekly. If there's a 10% drop in the price since my last buy, I usually double my buy. This [DCA calculator](https://dca.bitnob.com/) might help to decide what will work best for you. In a few years, even $10 dollars a month can make a massive difference. This [DCA blog](https://er-bybitcoin.com/) is pretty interesting too and compares buying bitcoin VS stocks. 

Now, don't buy some fake bitcoin at a spot ETF place or similar, **get the real thing** that you can withdraw anytime you want. Register at a proper exchange and buy real Bitcoin. Any of these will do [https://bitcoin-only.com/get-bitcoin](https://bitcoin-only.com/get-bitcoin)

**A STATEMENT SIGNED IN BLOOD**  
  
Two billionaires hang lifeless from the horns of the Bronze Bull on Wall Street, their bodies skewered and their fortunes distributed to poor people across the globe. Twelve cryptic words are carved into each man’s chest.  
  
Cal, a former military investigator specializing in digital forensics, is called in to make sense of the murders.  
  
Haunted by the memory of a death he wishes he could undo, he's determined to stop the violence. But as they dig deeper, he finds himself in the crosshairs of a bloody crusade intent on turning the technology he believes in into a weapon of war.  
  
Set against the backdrop of America's Independence Day, the killings transform the nation's symbolic locations into scenes of terror.  
  
*Blood of the Bourgeoisie* is a thought-provoking thriller about wealth, justice, and the perilous space where technology and morality collide.

That even with it becoming mainstream slowly, part of political space etc, it's still is absolutely punk at its core: anyone can contribute to it on different levels (code, documentation, education, or just holding), anyone can take any part of it and change it, and as long as its within the consensus rules, nobody can do anything about it. Nobody can be excluded from making transactions on the protocol level. Nobody can be excluded from using the code however they desire. Anybody has the power to be their own bank, with all the implications and responsibilities that follow, but nobody *has* to. Everything is voluntary and permissionless. Everything is rough but works and has been going through various attacks and crises, like a battle hardened tank.  

edit: just to clarify: specifically referring to the punk DIY ethos (if you want something done, you can code it yourself) and the ""rules, but no rulers"" spirit ||| I'm continually astounded how the prophetic-feeling descriptions of bitcoin's potential value made long ago keep coming true right before our eyes, and yet mainstream people still have no idea what is going on.  I remember asking banker types about bitcoin and being met with blank stares or outright condemnation for even considering it.  The store-of-value argument wouldn't do anything to move the needle on this.  

Fast forward six years and corporate treasuries, institutions, and sovereign states are buying it up; it is the best performing asset during the time period and it isn't even close; you have a chart before you showing 10+ years of price action showing you everything you would choose to learn about how it performs, with no signs of slowing down.

Still, crickets.  I met casually with two bankers today who were mystified by what the US would do about its national debt.  I postulated that we'd need to inflate our way out of it, and that a hard asset like bitcoin would be valuable in such a scenario.  Their response was literally, like ""what even \*is\* bitcoin?""  and ""it's not like we even have any way of ascribing a market value to it.""  They didn't even think one could use a centralized exchange to determine value...  Unbelievable.  Your average American financial professional still has no. fucking. clue.

Tl;dr -  You're all extremely early, fellas. ||| I am amazed me as a 80 IQ was able to understand what's going on on fiat world. I saw an escape I took it! ||| Like you've said.

Because let's be honest, what 18 yr old has 7k to max out a ROTH.  If you're buying BTC and staking it in cold storage you can pretend it's your kids but, it's really not.

Look up your states guidelines for a UTMA or UGMA.  I'm in TX so they get it at 21.  Thats another reason I opened the 529s because 21 is a little young for too much access to a large amount of money.  Idk hopefully I can raise them right and they just use it as a brokerage account.  But they will probably blow it and learn that lesson the hard way when they have their own kids. I chose the New Hampshire 529s and put the bulk in NHFSMKX98 which is the S&P and NHXINT906 which is international ex US.  The UTMAs are mostly ITOT, SPDW, FTEC, QQQM, and BTC.

There was a website called New Liberty Standard that started selling bitcoins in 2009, the same year that Bitcoin was launched. New Liberty Standard only accepted PayPal and you were able to buy 1600 BTC from New Liberty Standard for $1 in late 2009.

The Mt.Gox bitcoin exchange started operating in July of 2010.  

You could buy bitcoins from bitcoin sellers on #bitcoin-otc on freenode IRC. The channel #bitcoin-otc on freenode IRC was started in October 2010.  

You could buy bitcoins from users on the Bitcoin Forum which is now called Bitcointalk. 

You could use a graphics card to mine bitcoin from July 2010 until sometime in 2012. 

Bitstamp, Bitinstant, Bitfloor and several other Bitcoin exchanges started operating in 2011. Some of these other exchanges were very easy to use and you could buy bitcoin by anonymously depositing cash at a bank in the US. Bitinstant enabled users to buy bitcoin with cash at Walmart, CVS, Duane Reade, 7-Eleven and several other stores in the US. 

Coinbase, Bitcoin24, the peer-to-peer bitcoin exchange LocalBitcoins and several other exchanges started operating in 2012. Many of these bitcoin exchanges were actually easier to use back then because they didn't request any KYC information. Coinbase didn't even request any KYC information back then. ||| I attempted to buy a few hundred coins when it was under $10... but I couldn't figure out how to do it without directly linking my bank account to one of the exchanges... which, unfortunately, I felt was too risky.

I did spend about two days actively trying to get BTC, I'm sure if I had I would have sold it all for 500% profit and collected $1,000 on my $200 investment. That's what most did at the time.

My time would have been far better served mining. At that time, you could reasonably expect to get 50 BTC from a block overnight using your laptop. I'm not salty... at all... live and learn. ||| I mailed a paper check to a PO box.  It was very wild back in the day. ||| None of you wanted it hard enough.

Its pretty rare these days, because most vendors who take fiat will find it much easier to take non paper payments via the visa network or fiat bank wires.

One limitation is that you have to keep it to a trivial total amount, because police can just steal your paper fiat when you go over 2999 USD units, with no crime nor charges or even arrest. So never carry more than that.

If you have to draft a old fashioned bank cheque for more than 3000, you really just have to open an account for it. You could keep the account empty and only fund it as needed. 

This is pretty much fallout of the monopoly on money; they want it to be difficult to get off their cartel network.

More currency units = less buying power of said unit = more units to buy the same thing. 

The question becomes can you get some bitcoin and be able to hang onto it for as long as you possibly can? You should be setting aside any fiat you know you wont need in the next 4 years in bitcoin. As holding it in currency is a fools errand. Just this year alone the US dollar has lost 10% of its buying power. Did you increase you wages by 10%  this year? If not you just got poorer buy doing nothing other than being responsible and not spending your money. The game is rigged, dont hold onto a thing another man can create for free. ||| It's not a question of being late. There are only 21 million coins ever produced, the opportunity to trade your garbage fiat for bitcoin at such a price is literally an opportunity of a lifetime. This is a rare, important and revolutionary time in human history.

If Bitcoin hits $10M, you're buying now at a 99% discount. By that time, the entire world will use and want some.

Bitcoin is a long-term hold. You don't buy this with hope to cash out soon. It will reward you the longer you hold it, and because it's young and volatile, the price will go up significantly after you sell it.

Example: a man sold his house for $300k some years back and was able to buy 100 bitcoin. A couple years later the house he sold was worth $400k because of inflation. He would have been able to buy the home back for just 4 bitcoin (worth at the time $100k), leaving him with 96 bitcoin left over -- worth $10M.

If he held those 96 bitcoin until it reaches $1M per coin, he'd have $96M.

If bitcoin were $10M per coin, he'd have $960M. ||| I thought it was too late at $1,000, $10,000, $50,000 and $75,000. Just started buying now at $112,000 because I was sick of the FOMO. ||| It’s actually still early.

What you’ll want to do is educate yourself, then you won’t be hesitant and will understand the timing on your own. Best of luck!"

Be forewarned though, I bought some a few weeks back and when I went to transfer it to my cold wallet, the fee was around $50. Tried numerous days at different times but it never changed. I ultimately converted it to USDT, sent to a difference exchange, then bought BTC back at the same price and then transferred it for $2.50. ||| It's the spread and is how the exchange makes money. ||| Damn I thought cash apps spread was bad but that’s a lot ||| That's the spread when buying with a credit card directly i think.

Not great at all. Better than Cashapp tho, bc same purchase costs me .99, which is basically a five percent fee in addition to paying a higher spot price. This sort of reminds me why I stopped buying silver years ago bc you always had to pay above spot price when buying it seemed, then under spot when selling. Ofc, with silver, I was buying cool looking old 1800 era coins which were pretty neat. Then again, BTC has a lot more potential imo so its a better deal. But the exchanges are making all the money here it seems to me. Love BTC and have a lot of it but thats one hell of a spread."

Don't panic. Export the extended public key again and look for options during the export process that allow you to change the type of extended public key (e.g. xpub/ypub/zpub) or the format of the public key file.

honestly kinda surprised we're holding up this well considering all the liquidation chaos from monday/tuesday. over $150 billion wiped out and we're still above $110k? that's actually pretty resilient tbh. the fact that we found support around that level and bounced shows there's still some serious buying interest down there.

been watching the technical levels and $113k seems to be the key resistance to break back above. if we can push through that convincingly, might actually see some relief rally. but if we break below $110k... yeah that could get ugly fast with all the leveraged positions still floating around.

what's really wild is how september's playing out this year. historically it's been absolute garbage for btc (like -3.77% average since 2013) but somehow we're actually green for the month still despite this week's mess. that's... different.

tbh the institutional flows are still looking decent despite the etf outflows earlier. whale addresses at record highs, and we keep seeing accumulation during these dips. feels like smart money is still buying while retail is panicking.

anyone else feeling like this might be one of those final shakeouts before q4 really gets going? or we thinking this correction has more room to run? curious what everyone's seeing on their charts right now.

also that whole microstrategy/bitcoin treasury buyback discussion from yesterday - starting to make even more sense in this environment. companies might actually need those traditional finance moves to maintain credibility during these downturns."

However, the U.S. left the gold standard in 1971. Today, if you buy physical gold as an investment and later sell it for a profit, you absolutely pay capital gains tax on it. It's treated as a collectible. 

Tax authorities like the IRS in the U.S. classify Bitcoin as **property**, not currency. This is the crucial distinction. Because it's property, any time you ""dispose"" of it—whether you sell it for cash, trade it for another crypto, or use it to buy something (like a coffee)—it's a taxable event. You owe capital gains tax on the difference between the price you acquired it at and the price you spent it at. You're right that this makes it very difficult to use for everyday transactions and is a major hurdle to its adoption as a simple currency. ||| Gold purchases used to be taxed with sales tax but no longer in Florida. Imagine if your state charged you sales tax to buy bitcoin. That is what happens in most states when people buy gold. ||| Keep in mind, even if your bitcoin never gains any value at all, but merely holds its value, that’s already a win.

USD dollars lose 4% (at least) per year.  Bitcoin being flat at 0% per year beats the dollar by 4% and other currencies by much more.

No capital gains tax if no appreciation. However, if there is any appreciation at all, only the gained amount is taxed, not all your coin. So, it’s a win win if there’s a gain in BTC value, and still a win (versus fiat money) if it stays flat."

2nd: Just Buy and hold
3rd: Don't leverage ||| If you want to hold Bitcoin for multiple years, a spot leveraged position is the dumbest way to do that. You're going to be paying exorbitant amounts in fees just to maintain the position. Not only that, but you also risk liquidating the entire position if the price goes too low or too high; your liquidation price is much closer to your purchase price the more leverage you use. Margin trading is only worthwhile if you're trying to make a short-term profit.

You might as well take out a long term personal loan (assuming you can get a good interest rate) and then buy Bitcoin at spot price with that. With a personal loan, your monthly payments won't fluctuate and you have an opportunity to build credit."

This is why it's important to understand the terms, and follow them. This can be simply taking back a portion of your BTC... or paying back the USD interest owed, and getting your BTC back (at a much higher value potentially).

In short, when you borrow against your BTC, you have to put it up as collateral, for the loan. You get it back if you satisfy the terms of the loan (whatever those are).

1npib9t;Fiat money is a scam meant to uphold wage slavery;Amphibious333;30;11;1758734707.0;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1npib9t/fiat_money_is_a_scam_meant_to_uphold_wage_slavery/;"> debt MUST LITERALLY grow forever or the economy will crash. 


I used to think this was probably true, but I no longer do. Imagine a $100 loan created from thin air at 5% interest rate. You might think ""where will that extra 5% come from?"" But no additional debt or money is actually necessary to make the money to pay back the loan with interest. If the $100 is used to build a factory that makes shoes, for example, and they make $1 profit per shoe, they just need to sell 105 shoes to pay off their debt. 


Where does the money come from to buy the shoes? That still doesn't need to be new money. They paid $100 to build the factory, and those builders might well need shoes and buy them. Money is circulated, and so all that needs to happen is for the money to circulate fast enough for people to buy enough shoes to service the debt. 


Like, if the $100 loan money is the only money in the entire economy,  and each pair of shoes cost $10 to buy, and people bought 10 shoes per month, $100 would change hands every month, the shoe maker would make $10 of profit, immediately paid to the lender for each of the 11 following months. In the last month of the year, the loan has already been paid off with interest, and the shoe maker can keep the $10 he made that month. All this while in no month was more than $100 changing hands. 


Money can change hands faster than once a month too. There is no theoretical limit, tho there is a measurable average. This is related to the velocity of money which has recently been around [once every 2 months](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2V).


The problem is inflation of the monetary base, which underlies the entire monetary system, as well as the conditional changes to banking rules done to make it easier for the central bank to manipulate the economy. This is what sucks wealth out of the economy and funnels it to bankers and other connected elites. It's not fractional reserve banking, it's the whole host of other special privileges banks and financial institutions get at the expense of everyone else.


> Infinite money is good for CEOs, financial and corporate elites, such as The Rockefeller and The Rothschild


Infinite money is good for those who are close to the money spigot and can take advantage of the signiorage that comes with it. Most ceos and other rich people aren't directly connected to that, but of course may indirectly benefit by association with those who are directly connected. But even so, infinite money is not in general good for business or ceos or the rich in general. Their money is often sucked out by the same processes, tho they are generally better equipped to insulate themselves from the pain.


With a finite monetary base, fractional reserve banking will have a mostly finite limit of debt money it can create. The only way to increase that limit without increasing the base money supply is to increase the velocity of money, which is likely a function of the efficiency of the economy. ||| Bitcoin is liberation ||| I don't appreciate when people equate slavery with debt taken on more or less based on individual's choices. If you have a choice to take the loan, and to have the education you have, and to take on the low paying job you have, and to stay in the area you stay, you're not a slave. Learn, move, and get paid better, so you don't need the loan, or get decent loan terms for the mortgage/car and can pay them off sooner. Slavery was, and still is, a horrific practice. If you're not bought and sold, not chained to the wall, not getting randomly beaten and raped, you're not a slave. You're a product of your choices and your environment. Unless you can't change literally anything about those things, stop whining.

Also, the argument about finite money supply being the fix to everything - are there any examples in history of long term successful implementation of such a system? Where everybody from the top to the bottom were happy enough with their lot? ||| Damn bro, it’s like finally connecting the dots like I did in 2019 after investing in shit coins in 2017 and being like….fuck money hahaha ||| Grumble much."

If you still feel Strike + Trezor overwhelming, give Ginger Wallet a try. It's free, and you can buy and sell with just a few clicks, and the Bitcoin will be stored directly in your wallet. ||| Also in UK. I use Kraken to buy, but Strike has a good reputation too.

I also use a Trezor for storage. Solid option.

So the Trezor is whats called a *hardware wallet*. It stores your keys such that you can send or receive bitcoin without your PC or phone ever having access to them. Even if your PC is riddled with malware, your keys are secure.

During setup, your hardware wallet will generate 12, 20, or 24 random ""seed words"". These words are used to generate your private keys. They will allow you to restore your wallet to any compatible device if needed.

The security of those words is much more important than the physical device itself.

These seed words need to be written down and *never* stored digitally. Some even stamp them into steel plates.

If you ever read about funds being stolen from a hardware wallet, it's because the user was either tricked into giving away their seed words to a scammer, or the user typed them into some internet-connected device, or took a photo of them which was seen by hackers.

At some point, you'll likely get scam emails warning of some kind of security issue and asking you to type your seed to ""secure your funds"". Don't.

If you ever find yourself typing your seed words on a keyboard, just *stop*, give yourself a hard slap in the face, and rethink your choices.

Aside from that, the other common way to lose your funds is if your PC has malware which changes an address in your clipboard, so always check that the address displayed on your Trezor screen is the same as the one shown on your PC. ||| Start by studying bitcoin, then buying bitcoin.

The bigger question is when and what will the purchasing power of $1M be at that point. I'd love for us to stop measuring BTC in dollars... ||| Have always said (since 2018) its either hitting 1 million by 2040 range latest or 2030 range, or zero. 

The reason Bitcoin is such a no brainer as an investment and i begged my friends to buy it (I don't as much anymore now that it's 100k+ but did religiously when it was under $10k) is because just by using common sense, 20 years from now, it will either be worth nothing, or a SHIT TON more than it is today. It's simple supply and demand.

Bitcoin's great design and current following has gone long past the speculation phase. It has the respected narrative of digital gold backed my the most secure, decentralized, and powerful digital program on the planet.

They way things have gone for BTC over the past decade, its going to hit that 1 million mark in the next decade easy imo. For the first time I'm thinking 100 million ($1 per 1 sat is possible per coin within 50 years. Yeah, yeah obviously inflation will have had a drastic impact to go along with that. Perhaps a loaf of bread is $100 by then.

Saylor came on NBC today talking about how he believes Bitcoin will be the new line/standard for credit as gold once was for 300 years. Digital gold (Bitcoin) will be the new standard and i totally agree with him on this. He mentions how he expects an eventual 10x market cap of gold for Bitcoin. That would put BTC well over 10m per coin. I could see that (100x from now) in 25 years or less for sure. 

What a great opportunity it is for people to stack SATS. Before long people will be referring to how many SATs you have, not BTC. A 1 million dollar price is a matter of when not if imo. It's 2 bull markets away i think. Cheers! ||| In 5-10 years probably ||| 2029 ||| I have 1 bitcoin for sale at $1 million USD.

I pay off the CC balance in full as soon as my monthly pay comes in to avoid interest charges. The rest goes straight into more BTC DCA that's then sent to cold storage. Outside of my emergency fund, I have no cash anymore.

Some funds are used to purchase additional STRK shares, generating income. I experimented with MSTY but it's not as good for this purpose. STRK offers downside protection with some upside potential and steady income that repays BTC loans and the remainder is reinvested.

Liquadation risk is non-existent as I have stable employment and only a small portion of my stack is used as collateral.

After a few years of learning, nothing else makes sense to me anymore. I do not own any depreciating assets apart from my car or really anything that'd be taking money out of my pocket. I sold my house pre-covid and fully intend to rent for the rest of my life. The freedom this way of life provides is unbeatable and my NW continues skyrocketing while I travel the world.

This process ensures the security and immutability of the blockchain, governed by deterministic cryptographic algorithms.

I do that for my sister years ago. Because she want it but she dont want to send money to a exchange and buy.

She dont want to know anything about, really nothing. So she let lay around the coins.

So i do that.

I sent her the money via PayPal. Afterwards, she complained about how complicated and difficult it all was and how stressful it made her feel.

If the percentage rate on your debt is greater than how you think $BTC will perform over the next month or two, then estimate how long that will be true.

If you really intend to hold 20-40k worth of bitcoin, a hardware wallet is pretty much non-negotiable. ||| This is not how a hardware wallet works. I have a Trezor hardware wallet.

Transferring from the exchange to your wallet will require a small transfer fee. Unfortunately, most exchanges force you to pay a much larger transfer fee than is actually needed for the bitcoin network to handle the transfer.

The “not $2M in 20 years” take is mathematically wrong.;whatiscalculatedrisk;245;184;1758584815.0;https://i.redd.it/ax5zwmejzsqf1.jpeg;"My view is that part of the growth rate is based on adoption, and part of it is based on inflation. As the adoption curve flattens out, inflation will drive most of the price growth.  

In other words, once you factor out inflation, most of what is happening is adoption, and that doesn’t keep going forever. For most s shaped adoption curves, adoption slows once you hit somewhere around 50 percent adoption.

What is your reasoning why it relates to liquidity? ||| ETFs don’t simply acquire bitcoin.  People invest in the fund which then buys bitcoin, and allegedly their shares map to the bitcoin.  It’s not all that different than an exchange, like Coinbase.  MSTR buys a lot of bitcoin to implement their strategy, but people invest in shares of the company.  Governments create bitcoin funds, but allegedly, their citizens share in the benefits.  All these represent individual investors, even though the degree of control varies and the mapping of the shares to the bitcoin can be pretty fuzzy.  Unlike cash, which you almost never really own, you can own bitcoin directly.  But your cash isn’t less liquid just because your bank controls everybody’s cash. ||| Companies buying bitcoin almost only buy. We have more and more companies starting to buy. ETFs have mostly positive flow which means most months they are buying more than selling. Companies together with ETFs and a few other types of buyers takes more and more btc off the market.

And it seems like we'll always have sellers, or price will just rise until there are.

Most of the reddit users are from the United States of America, that’s why you read about 1 or more bitcoins. Consider that in the USA a better house in a good location worth millions of dollars. You are lucky from this point of view.

I had opened a Mt. Gox account but never bought or sold on the platform. When it was hacked and then went offline it was one more data point that perhaps this magic internet money was bullshit. Wife's laptop for work died and she needed a new one. I formatted the disk on my Linux laptop and installed Windows for her.

I was irritated about it for a long time but I've since come to peace with it. There is probably a zero percent chance I wouldn't have sold at some point in the last 14 years so I'd just be kicking myself for having sold too early instead.

I think about it every so often and just shake my head, but I guess hindsight is 20/20. Even if I did manage to get my hands on it back then, who knows if I would have hodled through the turmoil.

I started investing in 2017, went through that crash in 2018 and stopped. Picked back up in 2020 and stopped again due to financial struggles, but have been getting back in as of late. Even though I don't have a lot, I'm still in the black since the average cost of fractions I own is quite low."

Not sure, but there's a little bit of truth in that statement so I don't think it's bots because that is the best explanation you're going to get. The US dollar is backed by trust, trust in the government to maintain the currency, accept and support the currency and how they support it as military might and colonialism, economic warfare, trade agreements, the Federal reserve, monetary policy and Central bankers. If the US did not have its military which allows it to take advantage of every other country on Earth for its own gain. Then the US dollar would fall faster than it already is. So in that sense, the US dollar is backed by military might especially since it went off the gold standard and even prior to that when it was on the gold standard, the gold standard was manipulated through United States trade agreements. So even then it wasn't really backed by gold exclusively but by trust which you gain from military might. 

All that said, it's not a solid backing. Doesn't mean it's not backed by anything though, it's just not a reliable backing. I don't trust the government. I don't trust the military. I don't trust that the country as a superpower will remain on top over the course of the next several decades. 

So for those reasons I don't trust the USD

 I do trust Bitcoin, or should I say I don't have to even trust it as it's trust by design"

I use Kraken for buys (reasonable fees, great customer support), but it can take a while to get set up and ready to buy. Also, if price is a big concern, use the ""Pro"" interface and set limit orders instead of market orders.

***However***, whatever exchange you use, if you're planning to use it for online transactions, then you should *withdraw* it to your own wallet before using it to buy anything.

An exchange is for buying & selling bitcoin. It's not a wallet and should not be used as one.

Most exchanges will follow the letter of the law like any financial services company, including possibly asking awkward questions about where you're sending funds.

Even if it's a totally legal purchase, an exchange will freeze your account if they detect any remotely suspicious activity (and what they deem ""suspicious"" is anyone's guess).

Once you withdraw to your own wallet though, the funds are yours to do with as you please with no permission or explanation needed."

If we only printed currency in the correct amount there would never be inflation or deflation, only normal price fluctuations owing to supply and demand factors.

It can be many things, and it’s an amazing creation and technology, but it won’t be a currency hence it won’t be a medium of exchange which leaves it as a store of value where govts, sovereign wealth funds and billionaires accrue it to the detriment of people who don’t. ||| It seems more like Bitcoin was made by US to become this ultimate currency that will replace gold and then all the countries will want to have it and US have large stock will then sell it for millions or even billions a piece to become a lender and getting out off its trillions of debt.

TY! ||| Hmm is this like the IRS rule where you can gift $18k a year tax free from your investments? ||| The only things that are certain are death and taxes.  Sounds like you have both covered!

Give him the wallet, and keep a receive address from it so you can add to it if you want to.  If I were you, I’d worry he wouldn’t be able to manage keys, so I’d keep a metal copy just in case, and not give him the keys.  If he wants to use the coin and the device breaks, you can buy him a new one and set it up.  If he loses mental acuity, work with his caregivers to convert this as cash into his care account.

Make sure you leave him the keys in your will in case things don’t go according to plan.

EDIT:  sorry, i misspoke - since you gave him the coin, he technically owns the keys, so you really just need to direct your executor to return the keys to him in the event you predecease him, and make sure the keys are not considered one of your assets.  Get your lawyer to figure out how you document this correctly.  You are acting as the custodian of his asset. ||| This seems like a pretty risky strategy to me. If you want to save on tax, just move to Florida? What if your older relative ends up owing others money? What if someone challenges the estate, and it gets tied up in probate? What if your family member falls victim to a scam in their old age?


Anyway, whatever, just make sure you file a gift tax return if you're giving more than $19,000. I think that's all you'd need to do?


KYC would be annoying on exchanges for your family member but honestly might be worth it so that the ownership is tracked upon death (and your family member doesn't have to worry about losing a hardware wallet). If your family member has an estate attorney, maybe they could put something a will? Anyway, the executor of the estate would just have to include it in the list of property."

Risks: Blackrock going bankrupt (extremely unlikely). They take 0.25% of your bitcoin (which isn’t yours, it’s theirs) from you every year. If the dollar collapses and governments ban bitcoin ownership (like FDR did with gold ownership) then you’re screwed. Blackrock will cash out your IBIT and send you devalued dollars.

Advantage: Super easy to buy/sell and you get 99.75% of any rise in btc value. 


Bitcoin:

Risks: Safe storage has a learning curve and if you lose access to your coins you’re screwed and have only yourself to blame.

Advantages: You and only you own your coins. You truly have hard money that has a fixed supply and can’t be printed or devalued by anyone. The more the dollar loses value, the more your coins gain value. No fiat currency in the world has done this over the long term; they all lose value, on average, year after year after year, because of ever increase supply. Bitcoin does the opposite. ||| I started with BTC on Coinbase but feel more comfortable investing in IBIT. There’s a small management fee charged with IBIT. But I believe there’s a fee to buy and sell BTC on Coinbase? I’m just more at ease with investing in securities. ||| So I own 50/50 because I don't trust any of the new finance companies to give me a loan on my coins. Although it's not the topic of this thread basically you need to give them custody of your coins and I'm not willing to do that under any circumstances. There's apparently another one where you add them as a cosigner but I'm also not willing to do that. Getting a brokerage loan on the ETFs is traditional and easy and it's very clear what your liquidation price is. 


However I finally got through to my parents. Self custody for them is a little bit too much but I was able to get them to throw a couple thousand in their brokerage accounts. This was of course right when the ETFs came out and virtually all of them are now excited about Bitcoin and are interested. However I don't want them to get scammed so them having 100% in the ETFs is better because they're not going to have the experience we have dealing with scammers.  ||| Fidelity self custodies their own BTC so it isn't sitting on Coinbase. Plus they have been a proponent of crypto and BTC for years. They have the same fee as Blackrock, so I like it a bit better than IBIT. Just my opinion, tho."

And the more users and adoption, the more liquid and useful. This gives bitcoin a runaway network effect that is almost impossible to catch up with. You can make a copy of BTC, but you won't have the massive decentralized network backing it up, the deeply liquid market, etc. There are thousands upon thousands, if not millions of altcoins and imitators, some of them almost perfect clones of bitcoin or ""improved"" versions, and none of them have come close to dethroning bitcoin. ||| Someone can create another cryptocurrency and it's been done countless times.

Bitcoins circulated freely for 18 months before they ever had any real monetary value. Now that the genie is out of the bottle and bitcoin exists, it's impossible to ever have a cryptocurrency where the coins are circulating freely in the wild for 18 months before they ever have any real monetary value because people would be speculating and gambling on this new cryptocurrency right from the launch, which is exactly what has happened with literally every cryptocurrency that has been created since bitcoin.

I am not saying there is no supply shock but the ETFs have absorbed 750k Bitcoin in the time your chart shows 750k Bitcoin being removed from exchanges. 




I'm not a supply shock denier I'm just saying that this chart is only checking what is available on exchanges and not what is being locked up in ETFs.

This chart looks like we will be out of supply in 3 years but in reality the supply is just moving around. People who buy it in their brokerages can sell it just as fast.

1nkp0u1;Promoting BTC locally;BTC-Max1e;12;12;1758241536.0;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1nkp0u1/promoting_btc_locally/;"Great idea. We've been following this formula in Vancouver for a few years now through our local Bitcoin Meetup group and it works!   
  
We meet at local coffee shops every Monday morning for a casual hang out. Every Thursday evening we go to a brewery, bar or restaurant. We also host tech talks and presentation nights with guest speakers at a local community center once in a while.  
  
Outside of the meetups there's a dedicated crew of us who will go out of our way to shop at places that take Bitcoin and drop in on them regularly. We'll give businesses 5 star reviews on Google, list them on BTC Map and promote them as much as we can.  
  
When merchants see that there's a vibrant and loyal community that supports them and they see Bitcoin going up in value, they start paying attention and telling other business owners.

It may be tricky at first to rally bitcoiners to come out and spend sats to kickstart the movement but if you start small and be consistent you'll get there.

I'd be happy to share more if you want to connect some time. ||| Who in there right mind would ever sell bitcoin? ||| Love the idea 🙌 Bringing Bitcoin into real-world usage is always positive, and events like “Bitcoin Nights” definitely make it fun and visible.

The only challenge I see is that a lot of holders treat BTC more like digital gold — they want to stack, not spend. Discounts help, but in practice people are often more comfortable paying with stablecoins (USDT/USDC) or even alts, while holding on to their Bitcoin.

That said, positioning your bars/restaurants as **crypto-friendly** could absolutely attract new customers and give great free marketing. Even if people spend stables instead of BTC, the effect is the same: you’re building a local hub for the community.

Personally, I prefer to make my BTC grow passively and spend from other streams (I even built a bot that handles spot trading for me) — but I’d 100% show up at a place that supports crypto payments. ||| At this point, bitcoin is more of an “investment” or “store of value” rather than a form of payment.

1nk5tdo;Bitcoin Mining;dry-meth;0;22;1758195309.0;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1nk5tdo/bitcoin_mining/;"In the beginning, every block (which is found every ten minutes on average) rewarded the miner with at least 50 new coins. Every four years, this amount halves, so four years later it was 25 coins per block, then 12.5, and now ~~6.125~~ 3.125 (down from 6.25 after the last halving).  


This is why I'm the beginning much more coins were being found, and that's why it will take many, manye years for the very last coins to get mined. ||| When hashrate increases, the difficulty to find a block will be increased automatically aswell. This works both ways.

You might find the timechaincalendar.com dashboard interesting.  ||| Roughly every two weeks, the difficulty is adjusted to drive the block rate to one every ten minutes.  The hash rate goes up, more blocks are found and the difficulty factor increases.  The hash rate goes down, less blocks are found, and the difficulty goes down.  So it’s an average of one block every 10 minutes whether the number of miners double, or it’s just one guy with a laptop. ||| Bitcoin are not ""found"".


(That's a pet peeve of mine why I don't like the term ""mining"", because it implies that miners search for and then find Bitcoin that were already there, but somehow ""hidden"", just like they search for and then find hidden gold or diamonds or some such. Well, that's not how Bitcoin mining works.)


Again, Bitcoin are not found, the are generated. And the algorithm for how they are generated is fixed and cannot be changed (essentially).


And this algorithm says, that a certain amount of fresh Bitcoin is generated for each block that is ""mined"", as a reward for the miner who mined that block.


And also, the algorithm is set up so that, on average, one new block is mined every 10 minutes. So the fresh new Bitcoin are also generated every 10 minutes.


And the way the algorithm works, it is impossible to shorten this 10 minute interval. We are stuck with getting just one new block and the associated generated new reward Bitcoin every ~10 minutes, no more no less. That simply cannot be changed.


(The reasons why this cannot be change are complex and involve stuff like blockchain forks, community consensus, alt coins, etc. You can delve into this rabbit hole if you want, but otherwise, just accept that it cannot be changed.) ||| There is a difficulty adjustment mechanism working every 2016 blocks.

1nk55ag;The Role of Nodes in Mining Consensus: A Critical Examination;No-Put7619;10;20;1758193172.0;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1nk55ag/the_role_of_nodes_in_mining_consensus_a_critical/;"> This perspective suggests that nodes lack real agency and exist merely for ceremonial purposes, with their value in rule enforcement being purely symbolic.  

The agency of a node is to prevent the node user from being defrauded (tricking him into accepting invalid transactions, doublespent coins, or otherwise transactions/blocks that break some rules of the protocol).  It doesn't have the agency of rejecting perfectly valid transactions when they are mined into a block.  

It can of course have its own, individual rules for the mempool, or just not having a mempool altogether, but that doesn't determine what kind of transactions are being mined into blocks. Again, as long as a transaction in a block is valid, a node doesn't have an agency to reject this block (without forking itself off the rest of the network). It only has an agency to reject invalid blocks. Rejecting valid transactions on the mempool level doesn't mean that they are prevented from included into blocks. 

>  if you believe that nodes serve any purpose in determining what data gets included in a block   

It can't dictate what gets included, it can only detect when something invalid is included and only then it has the agency to reject it (and stay in tune with the rest of the network). ||| OP, this is not a critical examination.  You have inferred how certain parts of bitcoin work based on some recent talking points rather that seeking out a fundamental education on the topic.

>all previous blocks must remain compatible with the new rule.

The way you expressed this was ass about, which was the first hint of problems to come.

>we must question the purpose of nodes themselves.

So, did you actually seek out information about ""what role do bitcoin nodes serve"" or ""why are bitcoin nodes necessary""?  No.  You leapt to some conclusions based on the limited information you are working with.

>This perspective suggests that nodes lack real agency and exist merely for ceremonial purposes

This was really the final straw for me.  Your chain of reason is making compound mistakes and arriving at more and more bizzare conclusions.

Nodes are explained in the [white paper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf), though at the time nodes and miners were the same entity conceptually, just be cognisant of that.

Here's another resource that might help clear up some confusion.  [https://river.com/learn/what-is-a-bitcoin-node/](https://river.com/learn/what-is-a-bitcoin-node/) ||| There is only one set of Bitcoin consensus rules. They define what blocks and transactions are valid. Miners must follow them, but so must every full node.

Why are you acting like mining has some separate set of rules?

We've already been through this fight, it was called the Blocksize Wars. When the large mining companies aligned against the node runners they lost. ||| Yes, nodes have nothing to do with what gets mined. But if miners mine something a node doesn't accept, the node won't accept any transactions in that block. This isn't exactly novel.


None of that has anything to do with why node relay rules should match miner rules: the reason is purely one of efficiency, not of ""agency""."

Bitcoin held on platforms such as Coinbase, Binance, River or Strike will absolutely turn into this in a few decades. ||| I got the same message. You do not have to have a minimum balance to avoid the fee if you still do the minimum direct deposit each month. If you are already doing that, nothing changes. That is how I avoid the fee too. 

But I agree, there is no fee when being your own bank, just more risk. In a sense, the monthly fee is the cost of offloading much of the risk onto the bank and is a means of having the money insured by FDIC. Wells Fargo gets bailed out if they go under and you get your money back, but that’s not true for self-custody. 

A fee isn’t a penalty. A fine is a penalty. A fee is the cost of doing business to get a service you want someone to provide you. Do you consider it being penalized when there are transaction fees for transferring bitcoin? No, it’s just a cost for the service provided by miners and node operators. ||| > there are no minimum balance requirements  

Technically, the ""minimum balance requirement"" of a bitcoin UTXO is that its worth is above the current fee rate, which is associated with moving this UTXO. So if you have $10 worth of btc sitting on an address, but the current fee rate is $11 for an average transaction, your btc is below the minimum balance, in an economical sense.  

That's why it's frequently recommended to keep your UTXO values above a certain limit (0.001 or so), otherwise you're risking them becoming uneconomical to move in periods of high fee rates."
1njglry;DCA Strategy – Daily, Weekly, Monthly, or Lump Sum?;OGA_Blake;3;8;1758123659.0;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1njglry/dca_strategy_daily_weekly_monthly_or_lump_sum/;"If you listen to somebody like Michael Terpin (Bitcoin Supercycle), buy in the low points of ""bitcoin winter"" then sell at the peaks of bitcoin summer when prices are irrationally high. That's if you believe the price cycle revolving around miner halvings will continue.

If you listen to someone like Michael Saylor, buy as much as you can all the time. Buy at the lows, peaks and in between and buy nothing else. Put all your money into bitcoin, sell your possessions and buy bitcoin, mortgage your house to buy more bitcoin because it's going up forever, Laura.

I tend to be fairly conservative in my investing so I'm not taking the Michael Saylor approach. I'm not converting any 401K balances or borrowing to accumulate bitcoin. But I am putting all my expendable, savable cash into BTC.  I do have some company stock outside of my 401K that I may eventually sell and buy bit with. My goal is in the short term to have 1% of my total assets in it, and eventually get to 5-10%. Longterm HODL, not timing the market (not my strength). ||| Daily DCA works great for discipline, but fees can stack up over time. Personally, I like weekly buys — keeps costs down while still smoothing out volatility. Lump sum only makes sense if you’re confident in timing, and most folks get burned trying that. ||| It is best to know the bitcoin cycle with its halvings and buy on the dip monthly. That's how I see it ||| lump sum = higher expected value, higher variance  

DCA (averaging) = lower variance, lower expected value  

The two main questions you have to ask yourself: can you stomach a drop down 10%, 20%, 30% or something like that the day after you bought? And are you comfortable with holding such a large sum in bitcoin in the first place (meaning, have you got a hardware wallet, have you done a proper backup, did you test your backup, do you know what to do if your device bricks, do you understand what a seed phrase is etc etc).  

If the answer to both question is a yes, then you might consider lump sum. Either way, it doesn't really matter all that much.  

One argument in favour of DCA beyond pure EV is that it gives you a bit of time to get accustomed to bitcoin storage/transactions before jumping in with larger amounts.  

This is all under assumption that you can stomach losing all your money completely and your life will still be fine. [Don't invest what you cannot afford to lose](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7gi55s/dont_invest_recklessly/) and all that. ||| When I started my journey, I was definitely in the “lump whenever you have the cash” category. The problem I found with that was that all kinds of extenuating circumstances got in the way of me saying “yeah, I have the cash”. I missed a lot of good-buy opportunities because the price ticker just wasn’t a thing when I didn’t feel like I had the cash. These days, it’s budgeted in and my DCA happens regardless of extenuating circumstances (e.g. “pay yourself first”). I still keep a bit on the side for when I want to smash buy, but on the daily I sleep well knowing my stack keeps getting bigger."

Long-term still bullish, short-term just messy noise. ||| People are emotional creatures. They end up buying at market highs due to FOMO and selling at lows due to panic. They do this even when they know the opposite, buy low/sell high, is what they should do. 

This is why dollar cost averaging and unmanaged target-date funds work well for many people. It takes the emotion out of it.

So, I think you’re right. Because in the short term, people almost always tend do the opposite of what they know they should do. Eventually, they see this in retrospect when enough time has tempered the emotion.

“I should never have sold xxxx !  The market went up big, before I could get back in!”

“I should have bought when it was so low! But it was down, no one else was buying, just talking about how no one is wants xxxx anymore.” ||| A lot of people are still in a fiat mindset. Their goal is to accumulate dollars; BTC and other investments are a means to that end.

Once you’re a maxi the goal shifts to accumulating BTC."

You came here because you know the answer. Bitcoin is superior. ||| Gold ofc. I'd never buy Bitcoin that also explains why I'm active on this sub. /s ||| The arguments for gold are very similar to Bitcoin’s. Gold has an advantage in that it has thousands of years in history and has proven itself to be a reliable and somewhat steady store of value. The price of gold has been surging lately which is not surprising considering all that has been happening in the macro economy and the looming threats to our financial wellbeing. 

History aside, bitcoin shares all these strengths with additional benefits such as better security, portability, divisibility, transaction speed and decentralization. But bitcoin’s biggest advantage IMO, is that we’re still early in BTC’s adoption curve. As more people, institutions, corporations and governments adopt bitcoin, even on a small scale, demand will continue to increase, sending the price higher, attracting more investors, creating a possibly endless feedback loop that transfers all wealth into bitcoin. 

I don’t think it’s a bad idea to diversify into gold, but if I had to choose just one, the choice is easy. Bitcoin. ||| One thing that should be said about gold is that when it increases in price more people will mine it at a faster rate and more gold will be introduced into the supply at a faster rate than if the price hadn’t increased which will cause the value of the gold to fall back down whereas bitcoin has a difficulty function programmed into it which makes the mining process easier or more difficult to compensate for the amount of miners on the network which ensures that price increases don’t result in bitcoin being mined quicker.

1nj3gee;Have you ever mentioned Bitcoin to your ''entrepreneur'' friends?;unthocks;28;53;1758082935.0;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1nj3gee/have_you_ever_mentioned_bitcoin_to_your/;"Frame it as a new technology you're researching, not an investment pitch. Ask if they've looked into it as a hedge against inflation, similar to gold. Their reaction will tell you if the conversation is worth continuing. ||| Complicated 😂😂 a friend was already fired from the hospital he worked for because he kept talking about buying and that he was going to show how he did it on Binance 😂😂 ||| It's just one of those things that many will miss out on. It is respectable, secondarily buying gold. It's still hedging against the decline of fiat. So anyone, at least doing that, is respectable. ||| You can have a conversation about it, without trying to convince them to spend their money on it. They’re grown adults, they can come to that conclusion themselves  ||| As someone who has talked to many family and friends about it, and even convinced several people to be pretty excited about it, I will give you my advice.

Treat it the exact same way that you would treat a conversation about religion or politics with someone who you don't know what their religion or their political affiliation or beliefs are. Cuz in the end, a conversation about Bitcoin or any other worldview topic is basically the exact same thing. 

If you avoid discussing religion and politics at all costs with everybody, then don't bring up Bitcoin to people either. If you are going to preach and shove your Bitcoin opinions down other people's throats non-consensually, then please don't even bother talking to anybody about Bitcoin. 

But if you can have casual conversations with them without them feeling like you're trying to convert them, then go for it. In fact, rather than starting out, telling them how excited you are about Bitcoin, maybe start by asking them questions about what they think. Give them a chance to elaborate on their thoughts. If people think you're willing to listen to them about something they will often tell you. If they are the type of person who is afraid to say the wrong thing or wants to know what you think, first, they might hedge their response so that they can say one way or the other after they get a feel for what your leaning is. If you get the feel they are trying to avoid the topic like somebody would with religion, then you should mostly drop it and move on to something else, but if you get the feel that they are just hedging because they aren't sure whether you are pro or against the topic, then consider indicating what area you lean toward without being immediately and definitively overwhelming about it. They may then mirror in that direction, and depending on their response, it will tell you how firmly you can continue. Just be respectful about it. Don't come off as a jerk. Don't come off pushy or preachy. Make it a conversation instead of a lecture. 

For me, the real estate people are really easy to convince. I discuss with them some of the past experience I've had with real estate, including return on investment with equity in different cases, versus cash flow (I find that some states have real estate go up more in equity but have lower cash flow, and some other places. The equity doesn't increase as much, the cash flow is better), but either way, It seems fairly easy to show them the investment percentage increases versus the average expectation for Bitcoin. In a lot of cases, real estate is a pretty good deal if you're looking at 10% compounding, but that's also the average rate of increase for the S&P 500. In a lot of ways that's basically like the minimum standard. If bitcoins, 4-year cycle average even continues to decrease the ROI percentage every cycle for a while, I believe it's still going to outperform the S&P 500 and real estate investments. Granted with both stocks and real estate you can do some crazy stuff with debt leverage multiples. But that also comes with a lot of added risk. For somebody open to a discussion of return on investment, and being familiar with property and equity of some kind, it's pretty easy to have a discussion about Bitcoin as property and equity. Then you are speaking their language within their existing realm of experience and interest. If you can then elaborate on the differences between upkeep costs, all the better.

I would kind of avoid the whole topic of it's early or we're so early or get in early. Those are all complete red flag ponzi scam phrases and concepts that make a lot of ethical and risk averse people strongly hesitate to even consider the asset. Don't make it about being or get rich quick scheme. Make it about being the Apex property, like buying property in Manhattan. The value and demand will always increase and go up. The equity in that property will outpace housing and the S&P 500 on average (IMO, not financial advice), Especially for long-term perspectives like a lot of people with real estate have and serial entrepreneurs think.

But don't get me wrong, a good entrepreneur can definitely outpace Bitcoin returns by a ginormous amount. But that kind of success takes a special kind of person. And yes, I know people who have turned $70,000 of startup Capital into a small business equity with a valuation over $6 million in just 6 years or so. So 85x ROI? Yeah, you could do that with Bitcoin in the early days, and you'll probably still be able to do it with Bitcoin even now if you hold it long enough, but I doubt Bitcoin is going to 85x in the next 5-6 years. It's not impossible, but it's unlikely. So yeah, entrepreneurship can definitely always have the potential to outperform Bitcoin, But a lot of guys who own assets like real estate and other kinds of equity, will understand if given enough time and information and explained in their terms. And not everyone's going to be interested in it and that's okay. 

Just please do not ever shove your world view in someone's face, including your excitement for Bitcoin. Just keep reminding yourself that to people who don't know as much about it as you, to them, it can seem like you are trying to talk to them about your religion or your opposite politics. If you keep that in mind and remember to respect that they don't currently share your same worldview, it will go a long way to helping you have a reasonable and more respectful conversation about it So you aren't some overzealous preacher or lecturer that they won't appreciate. If you make it an actual conversation and let them have some time to talk, it will go a lot better. In that case, yes go ahead and talk to them. If they send signals that they are not interested or uncomfortable, drop it or change the subject, don't push it."

It's going to take more than a small upgrade to overcome that network effect. The way bitcoin scales in layers means that most new features, bells, and whistles we want can be built in layers on top of it without the need for a whole new coin.

Not sure what you mean? Normally you would have a seed phrase, possibly coupled with a pass phrase.

To recover a seed phrase, use any BIP39 wallet, software or hardware (I would use a hardware wallet).

In that case it would look like a long string of letters and digits.

This is how people preserve wealth (not money) and avoid taxes. 

Taking loans against real estate, investment portfolios, art, etc. 

This sounds like an ELI5. 

You need cash to do things. So instead of losing out on the future growth of your asset you take a loan at lower interest rate than the expected growth; Expectations can change. It’s a risk based financial decision. ||| Strike is offering loans, depending on your region the interest goes from 9.5 to 12% also depending on the amount. I got one to try and it’s pretty simple and fast. ||| Sounds good on paper but what happens when bitcoin retraces 60+% from the ATH and then goes sideways for a full year.  Loan payments still come.  You need a lot of capital reserves to weather the storm for this to work which the big players do.  

If you have 1 BTC and take out a 1 BTC loan, you're playing with some serious fire. Remember seeing this at the top of the bull run in 2018/ 21 taking out loans against their mortgage. BTC dumped hard and then they're financially ruined.

Of course the best time to do this is not when you're looking to sell near ATH but at the very bottom of the bear. There's indicators that can tell you around when this might happen but no one truly knows. ||| Isn't this what Strike is doing with their product?

I've used Nexo for this and had a good experience. The process was straightforward, the rates are competitive (especially if you keep your LTV conservative), and most importantly - it gave me liquidity without forcing me to exit my BTC position.

As long as you're not going max leverage and you've got a buffer in place, it can be a solid tool. The key is treating it like strategic financing, not a shortcut. Sounds like you're already in that mindset. ||| Crypto loans are some of the most expensive loans out there as far as interest rates go.  When people get loans they shop rates and if you're shopping rates you would run away from crypto back loans. While they may advertise low rates, it all comes with a * where you realize you have to be some loyalty member doing a lot of business with them before you were to get any of those rates. Realistically you're looking at 12-20% APR. Nexo sounds legit, but that's besides the point

So It seems like a terrible deal to me and it depends on what you're taking the loan for. Why do you need to loan yourself money in the first place and what's the end game? Even if you can keep your Bitcoin I'm not trying to pay 12-20% to anyone in interest. Even if you need a loan, there are other cheaper options, and some don't require collateral at all and just go based on credit scores and financial picture. I have a $213k HELOC line available to me at any time to draw on at 7% APR. Of course, if you don't own a property, you can't have a HELOC, but there are still several better alternatives. There's plenty of credit cards offering 0% APR for 18 months that you could use. I have access to a 401k loan from myself at any point in time up to $50K and it's 8.5% but the interest gets paid back to my own account and otherwise the fee is only 1%. 3 easily cheaper options

As a concept using Bitcoin as collateral to get a loan sounds interesting and I guess I'm glad it's available but I would only use it as last resort because it's the most expensive way out there ||| ""I understand the risks involved""

You probably don't.
Just like many will claim they know what Money and what Value is, untill you ask them to explain in one sentence....

Realize you want to spend money that you simply do not have yet.
The argument ""I have it but don't want to spent"" should make you wonder how rational you in fact are.

You have found this nice saving account but just don't have the patience to let it grow to real wealth.

Some things he didn't foresee (or just didn't include them in the white paper) were things like mining hardware specialization (in the white paper node and miners are the same, which nowadays they aren't), overestimation of the SPV (simplified payment verification) technology, and he also didn't mention the 21m coin limit. ||| The whitepaper was the blueprint.

Bitcoin offers an unconventional path forward. As a deflationary asset with a fixed supply of 21 million coins, it provides qualities that fiat currencies cannot. Unlike dollars, which can be issued without limit, Bitcoin’s scarcity creates long-term appreciation as adoption expands. If the U.S. were to incorporate Bitcoin into its reserves alongside gold, it would strengthen confidence in the dollar while gaining exposure to an asset with global liquidity and neutrality. The gains from such holdings would not directly cancel debt obligations, but they would help offset interest costs and provide fiscal breathing room.  
  
More radically, Bitcoin could serve as collateral for new types of Treasury instruments. Bitcoin-backed bonds would appeal to investors seeking exposure to digital assets without direct custody, allowing the U.S. to access capital at lower rates while sharing risk with the global market. By embracing Bitcoin, America would not only diversify reserves but also blunt inflationary pressure, providing a safe release valve for excess liquidity. Geopolitically, this strategy would prevent rivals like China or Russia from seizing Bitcoin’s narrative as an anti-dollar weapon.  
  
Instead, it would integrate Bitcoin into the U.S.-led financial order. Critics rightly note that Bitcoin cannot simply replace $37 trillion in obligations, but its role need not be absolute. Even modest adoption could restore confidence, reduce borrowing costs, and provide an appreciating hedge against the risks inherent in perpetual deficit financing. Bitcoin cannot erase the debt, but it may provide the missing instrument to stabilize the system and shift the nation’s financial trajectory from unsustainable dependence on fiat expansion toward disciplined resilience ||| If Bitcoin's market cap were $37 T, the price per Bitcoin would be approximately $1.8 M.

Surely it would have to be even higher than that to pump their bags alone to $37 T which doesn't sound possible.

From there the phone will act as any other hw wallet, and transactions can be prepared on the companion app on a non-airgapped phone, or with any other watch-only wallet companion app (such as Sparrow or Blue Wallet).

Only correction I'd make to your post is to remove ""or Macbook"". A MacBook is a laptop, and the phrasing could be interpreted as a Macbook (not airgapped) being a viable alternative to an ""air-gapped laptop"". Technically it doesn't even need to be a laptop. Could be a desktop PC or an RPi. As long as it can run good wallet software, it's valid. ||| I agree 100% with your analysis. Real sovereignty is in the method and discipline, not in the apparatus. Their approach with an air-gapped laptop and PSBTs is the pinnacle of security, eliminating trust in third parties. The weak point is human error. Hardware wallets market convenience to mitigate precisely this risk, making self-custody “good enough” and viable for most, which is an undeniable merit. ||| Seedsigner is what I use because I didn't trust the USB connection to pass the data. But wouldn't you consider a Seedsigner a hardware wallet? Or do you make the distinction HW wallet/signing device? ||| Thank you for sharing this information"

Be prepared for Bitcoin to go up and down and if you can hold for two cycles (8 year's) I don't think we can go wrong can we? ||| Considering that Bitcoin is currently very close to all-time highs after having surpassed several consecutive highs with only small corrections, a correction is always a scenario to keep in mind. However, the idea of DCA (dollar-cost averaging) is precisely not to worry too much about market scenarios and simply buy a fixed amount or a percentage of your salary multiple times per month.

From a purely mathematical perspective, making a lump-sum investment is usually the best long-term strategy, as it keeps you invested for the maximum amount of time and benefits the most from price appreciation. However, there is an important psychological factor: many investors might sell prematurely if, after investing a large sum, the price drops. This can be especially painful if the price is near all-time highs, because if Bitcoin takes years to recover those levels, the feeling of loss can be unpleasant—not to mention continuing to buy while your initial investment is declining.

If you are aware of this and believe you can handle it, but this is your first time investing in any market, one balanced option is to enter with an initial percentage you decide and keep the rest for regular DCA purchases.

Going straight with DCA only means giving up some potential returns, while investing all at once exposes you to deep and prolonged losses. If you are considering the second option, it’s because you are willing to take on some risk, so combining an initial entry with a subsequent DCA plan seems like a reasonable approach. ||| Classic DCA vs lump sum question.
Lump sum wins historically if you’re confident about long-term upside, but it’s also the bigger emotional rollercoaster if the price dips right after.
DCA smooths that out and is way easier to stick with if you’re new. Pick the one that lets you sleep at night and keeps you in the game long term. ||| I would go with DCA, but I would have had 3 times the coin if I’d lumped it all when I started.  Really any strategy works if it keeps going up.  I also wouldn’t bet on the huge dip this cycle.  93% of bitcoin was mined in the first 4 cycles (well, 4.3 or wherever we are now), and the remaining 7% over the next 28 cycles.  The reduction in new coins entering the system will likely have less of an impact at this point.  So don’t wait for a dip which may not come to pass.  DCA is your friend with dips - when the price is low, you are buying more, and when high, less - and doesn’t care where the peaks and valleys actually are."

It doesn't make your setup more secure in terms of theft, rather more secure in regards of *knowing* that your coins are ""genuine"", that you actually got them sitting on your addresses and so on. And also it helps with being more private, since any node your wallet connects to can spy on you and link your transactions as belonging to one and the same entity (those transactions would look unrelated to each other for others observers of the network, f.ex blockexplorer users etc).  

Ideally, you would combine the security against theft/hacks of a hardware wallet connected to your own personal node (securing against leaking trust and privacy to third parties). It's a complementary setup, not an ""either, or"" thing."

Any seed phrase constructed per the bip39 seed construction rules includes a checksum that can alert you if you get a word wrong. This is an optional verification step. Not all wallets perform this validation of the seed phrase.

Electrum will warn you if the seed cannot be verified using the checksum. But allows you to accept the seed anyway. ||| For a 24-words-BIP39 mnemonic seed, there are 8 words (out of 2048) that will pass the checksum ||| Your assumption is wrong. ||| The 24th word defines the checksum (well, 8 bits of it, plus 3 more bits of the original entropy).

But since you did it twice in a row, then that is only a 1 in 65,536 chance and I would start suspecting that your wallet is not actually checking for a valid checksum.

Try this: The word ""add"" is easy to type, but if repeated 24 times it results in an INVALID seed phrase. Use it 24 times to create a wallet. If it lets you, then your wallet is not properly checking for a valid checksum. ||| Wow that's a lot. I'm now so sorry I engaged."

On a more serious note, lest we speculate about someone who is clearly either dead or REALLY doesn’t want to be exposed, I would argue there are many individuals who have changed the world.  Many for the worse, of course, but some for the better.  Ones that come to mind: Bill Gates for creating the personal computer industry in a real sense.  Steve Jobs for recreating it into something actually usable, along with the modern smartphone.  Clair Patterson for getting cars to stop spewing lead into our breathing space and our brains.  Elon Musk for making EVs into a viable industry, making reusable rockets that don’t blow up most of the time, satellite internet to serve unreachable areas of the world.  Many others I am leaving out, I’m sure, including names most people wouldn’t recognize.  And a whole new generation of changers on every horizon.  They are extraordinary people with often positive contributions.  Not common, but you will spot them in every generation.

If rates are cut on Sept 17, it’s basically the first real signal that the tightening cycle is over.

Lower rates = cheaper capital → risk assets benefit the most. Historically, every time the Fed pivots from hikes to cuts, you see liquidity flowing back into equities and especially into crypto (which acts like a high beta asset).

The tricky part: the Fed doesn’t want to look like it’s panicking. So even if they cut, the language will probably be cautious, and markets might overreact in the short term. But mid-term, that kind of environment is almost always bullish for BTC and majors.

More tellingly, had you done this starting exactly 1 year ago (52 week), then you would have invested that same total of $15,600 but your current $BTC holdings would be:

Weeks: 52  
Total invested: $15,600.00  
BTC accumulated: 0.16833499 BTC  
Current BTC price: $115,656.51

Which isn't bad at all, a +24.8% annual gain outperforms a LOT of other, more popular investments.

Of course, the results would vary greatly with different 52-week time frames in Bitcoin's history, some would show insane gains, some may even show terrible losses.

Remember, owning BTC can be a bit less liquid (in a practical sense) than an ETF product at a regular broker, so if you're often dipping into your savings to cover expenses, BTC might become annoying.

I agree with you that losing seedphrase is likely biggest risk right now, especially if you are new. I think this risk goes down significantly with familiarity. 

Only you know your personal situation and security concerns. Self custody is a privilege of bitcoin with responsibility. It makes most sense to take it into self custody as you learn the ins and outs of your responsibility. ||| about point 1. I see a lot of people here try to improve their security by coming up with different convoluted ways to improve their single sig setup. In those cases I think your right, it will most likely also increase the risk of loss. 

I advocate a lot for multi-sig for this reason. I also think it's not talked about enough on this sub, so I think it should always be part of the discussion even if it isn't the right choice for everyone. 

It also solves most of the issues that I worry about when it comes to self custody. I like that you have redundancy so you don't lose everything if someone steals your seed. You can have multiple backups of single-sig as well, but then you worry about someone finding it (even if you have a passphase, you don't want to lose your seed, then go to the backup and find that it's gone too). With a single-sig, you also end up having everything you need to do a transaction at the same location, so your more susceptible to $5 wrench attacks. 

I find that most solutions to these issues with a single-sig are just straight up worse. The setup is more annoying, and having to back up your wallet/public keys + metadata adds another layer, but I think it's well worth it.

Collaborative multi-sig is also an option. I think we'll see the market for these services grow a lot in the future. This might be a better option.

The market cap of bitcoin, if coins are valued at $1M USD, would simply be:  $1M USD x outstanding coin (roughly 16-18 million coins left?)  it has nothing to do with liquidity.

Think of real estate.  Consider this simple made up example:   

There are 10 houses on my city block.  The last two house sales were for about $100K each.   The market cap of my city block is therefor roughly 10 houses x $100K = $10,000K.  That's how market cap is defined.  Nothing directly to do with liquidity.  

Now to address liquidity, let's say that the other 8 houses last sold over 100 years ago. 

What's the market cap?  Same.  $10,000K

Liquidity affects supply, demand, etc.   Which DOES affect price (and thus, market cap calculation) but it doesn't CHANGE the definition of market cap, which is what you've done with your last sentence. ||| basic math ||| The hill you have to overcome is higher prices encourage sellers, and somewhat discourages buyers."

This ""boost purchase"" directly amplifies a token's ranking on CoinMarketCap's trending lists for 12 or 24 hours by increasing its algorithmic score, which is influenced by factors like search volume, social activity, and market performance—but the paid boost provides an additional, non-organic lift to help it climb higher.

You should wait until you have accumulated at least 0.01 BTC on the exchange before you withdraw your bitcoin anyways. So the bitcoin withdrawal fee shouldn't really matter to you unless you're using an exchange like Crypto.com that charges an outrageously excessive bitcoin withdrawal fee."

1nfpi0v;Power consumption and Bitcoin as a global transactional unit;wtftocallmyself;2;13;1757742065.0;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1nfpi0v/power_consumption_and_bitcoin_as_a_global/;"Bitcoin transactions are limited by block size not by energy consumption. Miners could use 1/10th the electricity they use now, or 1000x, and it wouldn't make any difference to the number of transactions that can be processed. ||| The **high energy consumption** we see today is **not a requirement** for the protocol to function. It’s a **byproduct of competition**: miners voluntarily expend energy in proportion to the **expected reward** (block subsidy + fees). If fewer people mine, the **difficulty adjusts downward**, and the network continues to operate securely. ||| This is a very common misunderstanding, but fortunately, one that's easy to fix.

It's the miners who are using electricity to settle the transactions. They spend money on electricity and collect fees to make a profit.

What this means is that the fees you pay to send bitcoin are more than, or roughly equivalent to, the cost of the electricity used. Miners also currently receive an extra subsidy, but this is reducing in value and roughly matches the fees received. In other words, if electricity cost them more than double what we spend on fees, mining would be inviable.

Currently, fees are under $0.50 for a standard transaction. Here are some examples that just settled: 

16c to transfer $400:
https://mempool.space/tx/b76a93f3b7c697de46ff9079284affe3012b9f8e5160a35bdc1f0752b7379fce?mode=details

50c to transfer $1800:

Those figures give you an idea of how much electricity is being used in order to send bitcoin. If they were using much more than that, the miners would be making a loss, and wouldn't be mining in the first place.

The scary power consumption figures you see around are anti-bitcoin propaganda and simply what you get when you add up lots of transactions. The same logic applies to every service we use or product we consume. The energy used to produce it must be valued less than what we pay for it, or the provider isn't making profit.

Edit: I just checked some recent blocks, and fees are actually significantly lower than the subsidy right now. Regardless, as long as you're sending over $10 of bitcoin, then the electricity costs to settle will always be lower than the amount transferred. As the subsidy reduces, it's possible that mining becomes less profitable, and as such, even less electricity will be consumed. Network security could reduce somewhat as a result, but it should remain highly secure. ||| BTC transactions do not use a meaningful amount of power.  

A single laptop was enough to transact at the rate we are now, back in 2009.

BTC transactions are not using energy.  The competition for the block reward is.  These are not the same. ||| That's very stupid take.

1nfgkw8;Coinbase btc rewards card;m25van;19;24;1757715257.0;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1nfgkw8/coinbase_btc_rewards_card/;"Ya, I got it already. Overall, I like it a lot. Here are some thoughts on it:

The design is pretty cool and very unique. And I personally like that it's an Amex with their insurance. It does not show up in my Amex account, it only shows up in my Coinbase account. There is no phone number on the back of the card it just points you to Coinbase's website.  
  
Cash back on everything is awesome, it uses the price of bitcoin at the time of the transactions and is deposited to your account as soon as the transaction has settled so you don't have to wait for your statement to get Bitcoin.

The integration into the Coinbase app is very solid, transactions show up instantly, it is a simple and easy to use design. Brands, like say Netflix, show up with the proper company icon.

It has a base cashback rate of 2% unlimited, and then a boosted cashback rates up to an additional 2% (4% total) on the first 10k a month. This is high enough monthly that it will cover my everything else category pretty easily, but it's not enough for me to drop all my other cards and only use it. I will still split my spending on some category points cards and use it as an everything else card.

Coinbase One is only 50$ a year, and you get 4.5% boosted interest on USDC on the first 10k, then 4.1% after that. If you do the math just the 0.4% boost is 40$ a year on 10k. So, I moved 10k over to Coinbase to leave in USDC and unlocked the first 2.5% boosted cash back rate. That makes the effective annual fee $10, and my 10k is earning 4.1%. With just 10k it becomes better than any standard 2% cashback card imo.

I plan to move more assets (Bitcoin and USDC) over to Coinbase to unlock the higher cashback rates, but my only complaint really is 200k is steep for the 4% rate. Similar cards like US Bank Smartly was only 100k, but I'd much rather have my assets in Bitcoin over cash in US Bank so I vastly prefer Coinbase.

If I compare it other crypto cards, I think it's the best one. If you're a high spender and are going to run into that 10k limit a month the Robinhood 3% unlimited cash back card might be slightly better. But like 20k on the Coinbase card with the 4% rate would average 3%, so I doubt many people will run into that issue.

I think it will be one of my main cards for years to come. ||| You guys are buying things other than bitcoin? ||| Yep I have it... This is going to be my main card ||| Gemini card is better imo ||| Just got accepted today! Very excited"

Hot wallets are online services that allow you to store your bitcoin. They are connected to the internet and always susceptible to hacking and are at the whim of whichever company you choose. I wouldn't trust any of them. cold wallets store your keys purely offline on a small device that you can connect via USB when needing to access the coins.

If Bitcoin had in 2021 “only” hit like $50k instead of $69k for like 4 seconds, we wouldn’t even be having this conversation.

To answer your question… Bitcoin doesn’t hasn’t yet taken away golds value proposition because people en masse haven’t yet believed in it that way. Gold is still the “fear and inflation asset.” Who knows when the “cycle” high is, and personally I don’t care. This is a long term play betting against the fiat and debt system.

As a result, I'm probably the only middle-aged male in my neighbourhood who does the weekly groceries for a whole family by bike, going to multiple places to get the best value for money (even though we own a car).

Also, if you're coming over to my place in the winter, make sure to wear thermal underwear and use the provided robes / blankies where applicable - I set the thermostat to 16C / 61F max.

A side effect of this is that I cannot get myself to give to charities anymore. I soothe my ego by telling myself that I am withholding this $10 now so that I can give them $1000 in the near future - but we all know that is never going to happen.

*(PS. Even though I do snark a lot on Reddit - the above is 100% real - adding this because I know when I say things like this, many folks assume I'm ridiculing)* ||| Regular DCA, half of every bonus buys more. I look at other investment ideas and compare it to Bitcoin and stop being interested. ||| Apart from selling stuff to buy more sats, don't ever forget to dca small amounts daily. the habit is life-changing. ||| I still have ways to cut out the wastefulness but bitcoin has taught me so much about thinking differently.

I thought my biggest “ah ha” was “oh wow! I can borrow from my 401k?!”

I borrowed from my 401k to buy bitcoin.

Over 1 year later, I sold the amount of bitcoin I had left on that loan. 

By doing that, I freed up my entire old 401k. 

The reason why I did that is I discovered that you can roll over your old 401k into a bitcoin IRA. 

A self custody bitcoin IRA with multisig technology.

To clarify: i took the 401k loan out when I was still an employee. I found a new job a few months later.  You can’t roll over a 401k if it’s still active because you still work for the company. 

My investment went up 85% in a year’s time.

So now I have converted the old 401k into a bitcoin IRA. 

I freed up that loan repayment money so I can buy more bitcoin each month. I live much closer to work so I can walk or ride a bike in & save myself gas money. 

I am also saving some money in order to pay the long term capital gains tax from the sale of that bitcoin that was used to pay the loan in full.

The loan had 10% interest but that was repaid to my account since it was a loan from my 401k and not a credit card.

It is all very complicated, I suppose. It’s like running a side business that I could run while on my full time job. Most of the moves I have made were from Ideas I got from watching youtube videos like bitcoin university, Michael Saylor lectures and asking AI to help me with the math. Reddit also. 

I now have my own personal self custody and cold wallets with bitcoin i buy each month directly. And an amount of retirement bitcoin IRA also held in self custody. 

Not too shabby. I will keep working and stacking. ||| Im all satoshi in my day to day thinking about bitcoin."

Trying to “buy the dip” can get you better entries, but it also means you need patience, discipline, and the ability to hold cash on the sidelines without FOMO. Not easy for most people (even experienced ones).

Anything that gives you exposure to BTC without you holding the keys (like ETFs, custodial exchanges, or wrapped tokens) is basically an IOU. The risk is the same as with paper gold: if issuers start running fractional reserves, they can create more “claims” on BTC than actual coins exist.

What keeps it in check:

\- **Proof-of-Reserves audits**: Some custodians publish cryptographic proofs showing they really hold the coins.

\- **Regulation**: The new GENIUS Act is strict about stablecoins, but you’re right, there’s no universal requirement for Bitcoin custodians yet.

\- **Self-custody**: The ultimate safeguard. If enough people demand withdrawals, a fractional system collapses quickly because unlike dollars, new BTC can’t just be printed.

So....yes, companies *could* create paper BTC, but the system is more fragile for them than for banks. One bank run would expose any fractional scheme fast. That’s why “not your keys, not your coins” is still the golden rule. ||| [deleted] ||| People wanted institutions in BTC, well… institutions bring paper versions of everything ||| Where we're going you won't need paper money. ||| Absolutely. ""Paper Bitcoin"" is already here , it's called futures, ETFs, and unbacked lending.
Wall Street can (and does) create synthetic BTC exposure without touching real coins. This dilutes price discovery and adds systemic risk, just like paper gold.
But unlike gold, Bitcoin has a public, auditable ledger. The key is demand for real withdrawals. If enough people pull coins to self-custody, it exposes fractional reserves.
Not your keys, not your coins isn’t just a meme , it’s the only defense.
TL;DR: Yes, they can.but the chain doesn’t lie."

The costs involved in settling a significant amount of gold with someone on the other side of the world, between transporting it there, melting it down to verify it, and then securing it long term, is immense. With bitcoin, you could send a few billion dollars worth to China, settle in 10 minutes to an hour, secure it far better than you ever could gold, and audit it from across the world at 3 am in your pajamas. It's a night and day difference. And, a key difference that can't be hammered home enough is the scarcity. There is always more gold to be found for enough effort, your ounce is an increasingly small portion of the total supply. There will only ever be 21,000,000 BTC and your coins will always be a fixed proportion of the whole.

And I should mention the open source, programmable nature of the thing letting us build open systems on top of it in a way gold banking could not dream of. ||| ""Yo Jim! Give me one of your Lambos.""

Absolute fixed cap of 21m vs no caps

Plus many more

Tokenized gold requires trusted central parties. Bitcoin completely removes this and lets the owner truly control the bearer asset. ||| Three reasons Bitcoin is superior to gold:

**Perfectly engineered scarcity.** New gold deposits are frequently discovered. And the more the price of gold rises, the more will be sought and found. New technologies will mine gold from the ocean and maybe from asteroids. No new tech will ever mine more Bitcoin than pre-determined. It's provably and mathematically scarce.

**Cannot be confiscated.** Gold can be taken from your person. Try crossing the border with $10 million in gold. Not trivial. With Bitcoin, you can memorize 12 words and carry it all with you weightlessly and effortlessly. A bad guy can hurt you, but if you do not give them your private keys, they go away empty handed. If they kill you, they can't get your Bitcoin. With gold, the bad guy can hurt/kill you and take your gold.

**Cannot be censored.** You can transfer Bitcoin over a communications channel to anyone anywhere in the world instantly, irrevocably, and verifiably. You do not require anyone's permission, and you do not require any third party. It is slow and very expensive to transfer gold internationally. And there is no guarantee it will get there. Any transfer point along the way can result in your gold getting delayed, stolen or confiscated. And when gold does arrive, how is it authenticated? The only sure way is to melt it down, test it, and recast it. Again, full verification is slow and expensive.

Generating a seed is easy. Generating keys and adresses is easy too.
Do that on a device (old laptop?) that is not connected to the internet (i detached the networkcard of a old laptop).

I'm not telling you which was to go, just to explore the pros/cons. I've asked myself the same question and have concluded it's not an either/or proposition. It may be worth having BTC-related assets both in self custody and also in a tax protected environment.

Not likely.

1 bitcoin ($113,000) is divided into 100,000,000 satoshis.  As of today, 1 satoshi = $0.00113 (one tenth of a penny). Even if bitcoin hits $1,000,000, that puts one satoshi at $0.01 (a penny). BTC would have to increase roughly 1000x from where it is today to $100,000,000 per bitcoin for a satoshi to equal $1; hardly devastating for the network.

But $100,000,000 is extremely unlikely to happen in the foreseeable future.  Even if it did, a software update by bitcoin core developers could be done to subdivide satoshis further, as long as 51% or more node operators accepted the update. ||| You can set up multisig wallets and other forms of inheritance planning. Truly lost coins are gifts to all of humanity. ||| No. Your btc are lost forever if you have own custody over them, and die or something.

The increase in scarcity will increase the value of all remaining coins. The best way to plan for this scenario is to setup an email based dead man switch. This is a service that sends a pre-written email to whoever you choose in a set amount of time if you do not login and reset the switch. You could set it to send an email to your beneficiary after, say, 6 months and the email contains direction on where to find your seed phrase and what to do with it if they are not knowledgeable about these things. ||| Lost Bitcoin makes all other Bitcoin more valuable

It only has to be an alternative that people can opt into to avoid fiat printing inflation. Existing beside traditional finance will create opportunities for people that understand what's going on. So long as no single entity controls it, we have an option to avoid rigged systems. ||| Gold being difficult to transport, secure, verify, generally settle, made it prone to big centralized custodians that made it easy to capture. Low salability across space naturally lead to paper taking over and gold rarely moving. Bitcoin alleviates a lot of that. And beyond that, the open source programmable nature of it means systems can be permissionlessly built on top of it in a way that wasn't possible with gold banking. And I think bitcoin is just so much harder than gold that the runaway appreciation alone will do a lot to move things in its direction.


Nothing is inevitable or guaranteed, but I do think it represents our best, most realistic shot of monetary reform. ||| Gold holds its value due to scarce supply, but costly to transport quickly great distances.

Fiat money is easy to transport distances (digitally) but loses value because it’s centrally controlled supply inflation. 

Bitcoin has the best of both. It’s easy to transport and gains value due to scarcity, since it’s decentralized.

“Inevitable” may too strong a word since it implies a guarantee. But once greater bitcoin adoption smooths out volatility, which we may already be seeing now, it’s growth will accelerate and “inevitable” may not be far from the truth. ||| As humans we strive to move from analogue to digital in almost every form for the benefits it brings, this time it's about money and bitcoin is digital gold.

It's the only known object in the universe of which we know the exact amount - 21m.

It's not going to be banned or made illegal, they tried and failed. The world's most powerful monetary organisations the IMF, ECB, WEF have all gone up against bitcoin and failed to regulate it, they have now accepted it, and governments conceded by cornering the on and off ramps by enforcement of KYC by ETF's.

The alternatives they offer - CBDC'S are vastly inferior but people and organisations always attempt to find the strongest currency. This is why they will fail with their attempts but they don't understand this yet. 

Early attempts of CBDC by African nations (Ghana if I remember correctly) have failed as the people chose not to adopt for various reasons.

Who can ban bitcoin, nobody - Vladimir Putin.

It's backed by the world's most powerful computer network. This same computer network uses approximately the same amount of energy each year as Argentina.

Invest in your knowledge, learn about Bitcoin as much as you can. The Bitcoin Standard book is a must read. So is Broken Money book. Get them and READ them both, please. 

Also, **don't reply any DMs**, emails, private messages on other social media, promising to buy Bitcoin from them or get rich quick by investing into some website. They all are scammers. Even the hot Asian chick, he's a scammer too. 

**Price wise, nobody knows what the price will be tomorrow, next week or at the end of the year.** 

**Try ""Bitcoin ONLY"" strategy for at least the first 210,000 block cycle**, you'll sleep much better. Newcomers lose so much money, holding garbage tokens just because someone on YT told them to. If you don't like losing money in [failed coins](https://www.coingecko.com/research/publications/how-many-cryptocurrencies-failed), avoid. 

Going DCA is probably the best approach, IMHO. 
Bitcoin to me, is a savings account. If I have some spare cash, I exchange it for sats. Once a week works best for me, but I'm getting paid weekly. If there's a 10% drop in the price since my last buy, I usually double my buy. This [DCA calculator](https://dca.bitnob.com/) might help to decide what will work best for you. In a few years, even $10 dollars a month can make a massive difference. This [DCA blog](https://er-bybitcoin.com/) is pretty interesting too and compares buying bitcoin VS stocks. 

Now, don't buy some fake bitcoin at a spot ETF place or similar, **get the real thing** that you can withdraw anytime you want. Register at a proper exchange and buy real Bitcoin. Any of these will do [https://bitcoin-only.com/get-bitcoin](https://bitcoin-only.com/get-bitcoin)

[https://www.sparrowwallet.com](https://www.sparrowwallet.com) - top desktop wallet 

[https://electrum.org](https://electrum.org/) \- Solid choice, Open Source and Non-Custodial, one of the oldest and most trusted Bitcoin Wallets. I prefer the desktop version but it works on mobile too.

**Lightning wallets** to consider (cheaper and faster transactions, great for small amounts):

[https://phoenix.acinq.co/](https://phoenix.acinq.co/) \- Phoenix - very good wallet, uses Tor for extra privacy, easy for anyone new 

[https://blixtwallet.github.io/](https://blixtwallet.github.io/) \- Blixt - great UI, fast and clean 

[https://zeusln.com/](https://zeusln.com/) Zeus - impressive wallet with many features, can even generate Nostr keys

[https://breez.technology](https://breez.technology/) \- Breez - excellent POS for small business owners as well as integrated Bitrefill 

Note: Breez does also a hybrid liquid/LN wallet called Misty Breez - the sats being on liquid means no need for channels although the payments take a few extra seconds. You'll also can get a free customable LN address. 

While talking about hybrid wallets, there's also Aqua Wallet although not IMHO as good as Misty Breez.

There are also custodial LN wallet but I would honestly avoid using them because you have to trust the wallet operator not to steal your money. Their only advantage is that they are incredibly easy to use, although it might cost you big one day.


**Hardware Wallets** (to store larger amounts):

[Trezor](https://trezor.io/) \- Easy to use, no matter how new in Bitcoin you're. Use the Bitcoin only firmware as it's safer than a multi coin software. 

[ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/) - air gapped, Bitcoin only, has advanced features but a new user will do fine with one of the great tutorials available.

[BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/bitcoin-only/) - another great little device, opt for the more secure Bitcoin ONLY version (less coins = less code = less chance for a hidden bug or a backdoor) 

[Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade) - air gapped, fully open source, Bitcoin only, great features. There's a newer version called Jade Plus, it has much better camera and overall is a better, although a bit more expensive, option. 

You can even [build it on your own](https://github.com/Blockstream/jade/), if you feel adventurous.  

[Seedsigner](https://github.com/SeedSigner/seedsigner) - another DIY, fully open source, air gapped, Bitcoin only hardware wallet, not for you if you're just starting up but something to consider later.

[Krux wallet](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/) - one more DIY hardware device, I love this one for many reasons. Similar to Seedsigner, it's fully open source, air gapped, Bitcoin only hardware wallet, that is not for you right now if you're just starting up, but something to consider at a later stage and/or to up the security of your bitcoin. 


There's also Ledger, but I wouldn't recommend it as it's not fully open source, keep and already leaked customers' details, recently said they're capable of sending customers' keys out just with a firmware update, etc. **Stay away**, save yourself a headache in the future. 

Whatever wallet you'll decide to buy, purchase DIRECTLY from the manufacturer, no eBay, no Amazon. 

Make sure the device is NOT preset, and you will generate your own seed words. Write them down on any piece of paper as well as the receiving address. Now wipe the wallet and generate a new wallet. If the seed words are different from the first set, you're safe to use it. 

Find an option to set a passphrase and use it. This will boost the security to another level. Never store the seed words and passphrase together. Use a different medium if possible. If somebody finds both, they'll be able to steal your coin. 

This little device will hold the keys to your money, that's the reason why you have to be a bit more careful. Also, no worries, if it breaks, you can replace it - as long as you keep your seed words and passphrase(s) safe.

Welcome to the rabbit hole and don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions anytime during your Bitcoin journey.

Also, [check the sidebar](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/about) that's filled with lots of great info and if you have any questions, visit r/BitcoinBeginners or r/Bitcoin and look for the answers. ||| You are asking in a bitcoin sub. So naturally, you should put it in to gold instead. ||| Imagine you have ten dollars. With inflation at 2% and prices as they are, that’s a pretty meaningless amount of money. Whether you throw it into Bitcoin or buy a coffee with it has no immediate impact on you. 

Now imagine putting that money into Bitcoin. It has a limited supply, and as such, can protect against inflation. 

In six months, that ten dollars might be worth -10% because Bitcoin is volatile. 

In three years, it will *probably* be worth +20% because humans are like little collecting goblins. 

Bitcoin won’t make you rich, but with long enough time horizons, it will protect what small amounts of money you do have. 

Put what you can afford to lose into it. ||| Sure"

1ncfv0t;Where does the confidence come from?;DollopGiver;114;185;1757415909.0;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1ncfv0t/where_does_the_confidence_come_from/;"The confidence in the long term value proposition for bitcoin stems from how Bitcoin solves the problem that prior forms of money failed to solve. It’s the first time we have ever had an asset that improved upon the features of gold in every way and also took the favorable properties of fiat (transaction throughput). The world NEEDS money to thrive, but the money has been toxic. Bitcoin has the first mover advantage as the superior money. There are other crypto assets out there but most of them fail in one or more of the metrics that make a good money, and will likely fail completely. Knowing the history of money, and the likely path of future money now that we have the technological capability for a better money gets a lot of us really excited to be on the ground floor for adoption. The most returns accrue to those who found it first. ||| It comes from education concerning both the fiat money system, and Bitcoin itself. You have to both understand the problem, and what makes a proper solution. Once you understand these core concepts, you are well on your way. 

Educating yourself is the key to being calm, rational, even confident in your decision to hodl Bitcoin.

Start Here:

In all things, you have to start with understanding the problem, before the solution will even make sense, and so many in our society don't even know the problem exists. That's by design. The truth of money has been cleverly hidden in plain sight.

// -- Understanding the Problem -- \\

Clip 1 • Understanding Money: The difference between “Currency” & “Money”.. What is sound money, and why gold (and now bitcoin) fits this description (This series was originally made in 2010, before bitcoin was well known). Feel free to watch all 10 videos in the series in your spare time, but if you do anything, at least watch the 1st vid in the series.

**Centralized exchanges (CEXs)** like **Binance, Coinbase, Kraken** are safe if you use KYC and enable 2FA, but fees vary. Binance is usually cheaper.

**P2P platforms** (Binance P2P, Paxful) can be cheaper since you avoid card fees, but you must watch out for scams.

**Cash apps / brokers** (Cash App, PayPal, Robinhood) are easy but often have higher spreads.

Best tip: compare fees before buying, and transfer BTC out to your own wallet for safety.

But for normies, choose a reputable open source Bitcoin only hardware wallet with a secure element, and choose a suitably strong unlock PIN ||| There are many aspects of security. And one does not exclude the other.

 - recovery in case your normal method of accessing the wallet fails it is lost
 - operational security, ensuring that the secret is not revealed to a bad actor during use
 - coercion security, ensuring that you cannot be coerced to give away the assets without it being noticed and hopefully stopped.
 - succession security, ensuring your family is given the power to gain access to your assets in case you die or become incapable.
 - while still providing protection from family and close friends. 
 - protection from physical elements. Time, fire, water, crushing.

As with everything in security there are tradeoffs and you have to pick a suitable level when applying a security measure. Both too weak.security and too hard/complex security are bad for your security.

Ultimately your wallet is the signing key(s) required to authorize spending of your coins.  Kt any specific device you use for executing the signature.

To build the security around your crypto assets you have a number of tools at your disposal, solving different but often overlapping aspects of security.


 - hard signing devices (aka hard wallets). 
 - hard ""wallet backups"". Seed plates and similar.
 - wallet passphrases. 
 - multisig
 - time locks, locking funds until a certain time have passed.
 - custodian wallets and accounts. Delegating the storage of the coins to a third party. (Yes, this too is a security tool, even if most often seen as a risk).
 - custodian safe storage locations (bank vaults and similar).

And many more.


A hard signing device protects your signing key from accidental exposure, ensuring that you can perform signatures in a safe manner without risking to reveal the signing key. There exists many different signing devices with different properties and risks.

A hard wallet backup ensures you have long term stable storage of the secret signing key, protected from the elements (fire, water, bitrot, electric damage, crushing etc). And also is a good tool to use when ensuring there is a succession path.

For hard wallet backups apart from different levels of physical security you also have the choice to split the backup in multiple locations, requiring access to more than one location to recover the key (n-of-m). This make it easier to find backup locations as exposure or loss of one location is not critical.

Wallet passphrases extend your signing key allowing you to vary the signature. Each signature variant is an entirely different signature (different wallets). Can be used both as a physical security layer protecting the key store in your signing device, and as a anti-coercion protection by creating a decoy wallet or hidden wallet with the hope of escaping with only parts of your assets taken from you. But you also need to securely back up the passphrase(s). Long term recovery of the passphrase is equally important as long term recovery of the seed mnemonic phrase.

Multisig is the ability to require more than one signature to authorize a transaction. This can be both an MFA method requiring you to use multiple devices when authorizing a transaction, and/or multiparty, requiring signatures from others which can serve as a strong anti-coercion protection.

Time locks can be used to protect the wallet contents from yourself and limit how much you can spend. Should be combined with a multisig bypass option to bypass the timelock when needed.

Custodian wallets/accounts. While often yelled at due to the risks when someone else maintains your coins these also provide a lot of security by enabling identity based recovery, mfa protection, much stronger cold wallet protection than you can master (but also much higher stakes from storing hundreds of thousands coins). Considerably reduces the risk that lock yourself out from.ypur funds by failing to ensure you have access to.your signing key, or theft of the signing key. ||| Encrypt the mnemonic  in your own way, take a picture and put it in the network disk. ||| Get a bitkey"

1nbx3r0;How will lending work in a bitcoin world?;etaoin314;12;68;1757359220.0;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1nbx3r0/how_will_lending_work_in_a_bitcoin_world/;"I'm no economist, but I think you're overthinking this. Gold existed as hard money, long before bitcoin. Lending happened when gold predominated. Bitcoin won't end lending, either.

Gold fell out of favor because global trade and technology required payments be made quickly, across the world, impractical with gold. Thus, Fiat funny-money took over.

Bitcoin fixes this problem. It's a hard money, but can be sent quickly and cheaply across time and space. Fiat and bitcoin would coexist with changes happening gradually, allowing adaptations. Fiat, bitcoin and gold will co-exist. Lending won't stop even if the money used changes for some uses, but perhaps not all. ||| I’ve tried to think about this also and I find it very difficult. Probably a side effect of growing up and learning everything inside of a debt based, fiat-centric world. I’ve come up with that either lending would become much less popular and more risky, used for projects with the potential for a ton of upside or something the recipient of the loan is very confident about, or that some sort of fiat money will still exist for the purpose of lending. Although, in a world operating on a bitcoin standard, you can afford that which is now unaffordable if you wait long enough, if the money gains purchasing power congruent with technological innovation. Maybe everyone will simply become less focused on material things ||| Why banks need to lend you money? Can't they just buy that appreciating asset themselves? They are not charity I guess.

You need to lend/borrow in currency you make income.  ||| I think people will settle for the price of housing not going up forever, because borrowing is much more constrained. If your here to debate that it won't work, gl. If you think you can predict how things will turn out in the future, gl. ||| Negative interest rates or payments that decrease over long-term loans (but still leave the lender in relative profit) are two immediate ideas. 

It won't happen until value stabilizes. We're a long way away. We'll operate lending and credit in fiat for decades to come. 

When gold was the standard, lending existed. 

It's the stability of the change in value that has to come. Increasing or decreasing doesn't matter, just need stability and direction of that time-value component for a robust lending environment to develop."

Stick it to the big man… I guess

Sounds more risky than it’s worth

I don’t know for sure but I’m under the impression crypto loans are like 50% of the coin value 
And if it drops too much then not yours anymore

The cons are:

bear market cycle drops 50%, you’re liquidated and it no longer belongs to you

And then pumps to the moon without you

I’d also be surprised if crypto loans cost you less than a typical mortgage rate right now ||| The con is a pretty epic con. The recent past tells us what happens to these crypto yield/lending entities. Also, you are risking your BTC which will be worth a lot more in 30 years, to have a house paid? Should be the other way around, get a loan in fiat, the longest you can get. Let fiat inflation erode away your debt while your bitcoin is secure and increasing in value. Why risk the most valuable asset you have instead of the most worthless (fiat)? ||| Something like Morpho is a smart contract so you wouldn't rely on the platform but on the smart contract. You could split your risk between multiple borrowing platforms if you wanted. Also you could consider something like getting a multi family house and living on the top floor and cash flowing the rent towards repaying the loan. ||| I've borrowed against my bitcoin using Morpho, but it was a small percentage of my stack. My rate averages about 7% but it does fluctuates depending on a number of factors. I started out at a 50% LTV but it's much lower than that now.

Ledn seems solid from what I have read and heard, but I have no experience with them. The rates are much higher, but maybe the security of your collateral is much better? Not sure on this one.

No matter which way you go, you're going to have a bit of a pucker factor adjustment period. Good luck. ||| Take the scenario where you instead get normy FIAT loan for the mortgage instead of leveraging your BTC. The threat of losing your house on a missed payment is basically 0%. You have plenty of BTC to use as emergency to pay your monthly FIAT mortgage if something goes horribly wrong financially. That's your financial freedom. Also, if you did get a loan with your BTC you still are paying that back in some fashion, so to me the chance of liquidation or other circumstances seems not worth it. If you need the down payment, sell some BTC for that. Then stack like mad to get it back instead of always having in the back of your mind ""I have this BTC somewhere but I can't get it back until I pay it the loan off"". That to me is worse than selling some and taking profits on your stack."

the money you get from selling your bitcoin to pay off your debt could increase substantially if you kept it in bitcoin vs paying off your debt which doesn’t grow as fast as the price of your bitcoin stack.

but since you said you are drowning in the debt it sounds like the debt is growing faster than your bitcoin stack. so sell enough bitcoin (but not all of it) to get rid of enough debt so that you’re not drowning in debt.  ||| Credit card debt: probably

But Uniqlo is just good conservative cloths at a far price. 

Definitely not low quality goods but maybe not name brand. 

It probably more that name brand goods usually come from US based and EU based companies and cost ridiculous amounts of money in Yen.  

Not only is the exchange rate not favorable but maybe they are tariffed locally because they cost 2X what they cost in the USA plus the exchange rate difference.  

I wish they would bring Uniqlo to the USA.   They have a few stores here but also everything it 2-3X the cost in Japan. ||| This is why people with 2.5% fixed rate on a 30 year mortgage should never pay it off. The dollar 30 years from now will be debased into oblivion. ||| It's not just that we ""buy junk"" with an inflationary currency.   We buy all the things at a higher rate.   Good quality things and bad.   People spend more because the currency is less valuable each day.   That's classic economics you stumbled upon.

Contrast that with bitcoins which is increasing so fast my eyes water, economically speaking, NOBODY should be using it for buying.  I bought snacks last year which I regret doing (ok it was a cool experience!) but the value of the bitcoin i spent on it now far, far exceeds the value of the product I received.  Anyway.   Deflationary currency rewards not spending.   

It's pretty simple.   ""Why would I buy this shirt for 1 bitcoin when tomorrow it will cost .5 bitcoin?  Yeah, I'll wait!""    Impact:  The shirt producer gets crushed because hardly anybody buys shirts (only those that NEED shirts, there will be almost no discretionary spending)    then the shirt business owner has to downsize / go out of business, etc.   People that worked for Shirt Owner business will lose jobs, they in turn definitely do not spend their deflationary currency, the cycle is vicious.   Nobody alive today has experienced a truly deflationary economy. ||| That's one way to look at it. A lot of factors can influence those trends though. ||| The government manages the money they way they do because they want spenders not savers, they want GDP so they can stay in office."

AI agents for hire will simply accept it that way. ||| Try it yourself. Use one of the agentic platforms, and tell it to make money by offering a service. It can set up its own wallet (online, in its own VM environment) , offer services, take payments, use the payments to grow its presence ...

While I don't recommend any, there are DeFi credit (and debnit) cards, no KYC, backed with crypto.

This leads to ALL sorts of issues related to taxation ... have an agent make money for you today, no tax tracking, give it to you in 10 years. ||| Technically speaking, an AI can do anything that a person can if it is online. Thus, it can fill out an online form, create an account, etc. It can't generate funds from nothing, but let a human seed it with $100 and it can then do what it wants with it from there, online. This is the basic idea behind AI trading bots. But it can also be expanded to many, many other tasks. ||| AI won't use Bitcoin like humans do it will operate on a Bitcoin-standard economy. Bitcoin isn’t just money for AIs it’s the fuel for machine-to-machine capitalism. ||| My best guess: An AI agent will be able to send and receive bitcoin payments using a bitcoin address and clearly defined criteria that you give it.

There's a common saying in investing: ""Time in the market beats timing the market"". The idea is to dollar-cost-average (set amount at set intervals) say every 2 weeks or month. This removes the emotional element of investing where people try to time the market and lose. Because of the averaging and time horizon, you still come out ahead.

Say you decide to wait for the rate cuts and market response, but then bitcoin jumps to $130k and keeps going up. Then you think 'damn I should have bought earlier (today at $110k)'. But if it goes down to $100k or $90k, then you think 'damn I should have waited for this'. No one always buys at the best times. In fact your emotions will encourage you to do the opposite. If it pumps for a week to $130k, the only thing on your mind is that it's going to keep going up and you should buy more. Then after the pump it corrects back to $115 and you realize you just bought the top. ||| If fiat keeps inflating, the long-term case for Bitcoin actually strengthens, not weakens.

This means that through the power of math, an near-infinity of private keys (and thus public addresses) are generated, deterministically. When you restore your wallet, you get the same exact addresses, every time. Simply put (the real math is far more complex), the addresses are the output of `hash(mnemonic + index)`, where index is the index of the address. So address 0 is always the same, 1 is always the same, etc. Each Individual address cannot be linked to another in your wallet, they all look completely different and there's no pattern that would allow someone to guess address 1 from address 0 (the power of hashing!)


When you restore your mnemonic in a hardware wallet then import it in your phone, the software wallet on your phone will look at the transactions in address 0, then 1. If there are transactions in 1, it'll keep going until it finds a certain number of consecutive transactionless addresses. That number is called the gap, and is configurable in some wallets. That's considered the entirety of the transaction history for this wallet. Balances are tallied up from all the gathered addresses and the total is shown to the user.


This is fully specified in [BIP-44](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki), specifically in the [Address gap limit](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki#user-content-Address_gap_limit) section. ||| > Even though its branded as a public key, when exposed, it pretty much ends your privacy in that all your receive addresses can be identified. To what degree is the public key for my account shared beyond my cold wallet. The companion program/wallet? Other servers? Does this vary by wallet?


Regarding this part, I assume you're talking about the xpub (or ypub or zpub)? This is public in the sense that it doesn't need the absolute protection that a mnemonic or private keys require, but it doesn't mean you should post it on social media. Usually, you'll only import it into a software wallet on an online system (like BlueWallet on your phone or Sparrow on your PC) for your personal use. The software wallet needs it to show balance for your entire wallet, or to provide you with receive/change addresses when you need them, for instance when constructing unsigned transactions. Your xpub doesn't need to be sent to a cloud provider to transact with Bitcoin, although it's not awful to have it backed up on secured cloud storage, for convenience. ||| As to the second part of your question, a ""public key"" corresponds to a single wallet address, and an ""extended public key"" would reveal all your receiving addresses."
1nayk6f;Concerning Government Actions;Significant_Bite3863;0;34;1757264510.0;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1nayk6f/concerning_government_actions/;"Low effort FUD. Bitcoin was never designed for anonymity. Government regulation is completely external to Bitcoin itself. 

Layer 2 solves the TPS issue.

AI will also use an order of magnitude more energy than BTC in the long term. ||| >  So bitcoin failed in anonymity if vast majority of its users can’t buy it anonymously because your wallet that you would send out from the exchange to cold storage is linked to your id

That's more a government failing its citizens by being overly authoritarian than any sort of failing on Bitcoin's part. The fact is, you can still acquire Bitcoin without KYC in many locations, and you can use Bitcoin pseudonomously as it was intended, if you want to.

Individuals have the choice of giving away all their personal information, and many do, for convenience and other reasons. This is true regardless of anything related to Bitcoin.

> Bitcoin can only process 3.3-5.8 transactions per second. With people saying it’s the future of money that is jokingly slow and on top of it there is hefty fees.

Bitcoin, like every network -- including the Internet itself -- scales in layers. Bitcoin layer 1 (aka the blockchain) has certain characteristics -- like an effective transaction limit -- that does not necessarily apply to higher layers. You already know about LN, which is only one such higher layer. There are also sidechains (like Liquid) and other federation models, proprietary ledgers (like Cashapp), etc. The properties of Bitcoin L1 are fine as-is. It's scalable enough for what it needs to do, which is to enforce consensus rules, esp. the supply limit.

> The lightning network introduced a third party in which you have to trust so you are not the “bank” anymore they are and u just fell for it 

LN _allows_ for relaying through third parties, but you can also use lightning directly between you and a second party. Even with third parties involved, they're only providing potential payment routes, so it's not really a matter of trust. Third parties never take custody of your funds and can't even see your transaction details.

Or by trusting a third party, are you talking about using a custodial lightning wallet? Because, sure that's a partner you have to trust, but that's not any different than a custodial Bitcoin wallet in that regard.

> It also can be easily corrupted by big corpos and government buying up the supply which we are seeing a slow trend of.

Bitcoin is secured by proof of work. Unlike proof of stake (which some shitcoins use), with proof of work it doesn't matter who owns the supply of Bitcoin. Owning more Bitcoin doesn't grant ""big corpos"" or ""government"" more control over the network. So your concern here is simply based on a faulty premise.

> The only pro is the limited supply which only matters if the demand is there (government can just ban it like china if it becomes a threat to their monetary system very likely)

Governments can outlaw whatever they want (esp. authoritarian governments). That's an issue between people and their own governments. Theoretically it would be difficult for a nation with free speech, like the USA, to ban Bitcoin because citizens have the right to communicate and on a fundamental level Bitcoin is communication. But even a free country can do authoritarian things, like confiscate peoples' gold, so sure, it's possible. But this also isn't a problem that's unique or inherent to Bitcoin. It's always incumbent on people everywhere, at all times, to reign in their governments and vote, perhaps even fight, when necessary, to ensure those governments don't take their rights away. Nothing to do with Bitcoin.

If a government does ban Bitcoin, it's nearly impossible to actually enforce a ban, unless the government is so far gone that they're fine sending jack-booted thugs to everyone's door. It takes a lot for a government to get to that point (assuming it started out as a freedom-promoting government).

I appreciate your adversarial thinking -- that's useful -- but I think you have some learning to do. No shame in that. Every issue you've raised is something that has been raised and debunked many times. ||| >So bitcoin failed in anonymity if vast majority of its users can’t buy it anonymously 

Wrong. Everyone CAN buy bitcoin anonymously by using BISQ, robosats, hodlhodl, peachbitcoin, vexl and other P2P places. They just chose not to. 


>Bitcoin can only process 3.3-5.8 transactions per second. 

Wrong again. It looks like you've never heard of r/thelightningnetwork before. We're talking about millions of transactions per second. 


>on top of it there is hefty fees.

Wrong again. Currently, the on chain fees are about $0.5 to be in the next block while fees on the LN are under a penny.


>The lightning network introduced a third party in which you have to trust 

Wrong again. The lightning network is fully NON custodial. Some people just CHOSE to use a custodial services. But custodial services were introduced over a decade ago ON-CHAIN, it all started with MtGox. 


>It also can be easily corrupted by big corpos and government buying up the supply which we are seeing a slow trend of. 

Wrong again. Bitcoin is POW. If it was POS, it would be troubling. 

>Also the ever increasing energy supply needed to sustain bitcoin to keep it running

Wrong again. Bitcoin doesn't need increasing energy supply. People CHOSE to use more energy because being rewarded in bitcoin is worth it. 


>Please genuinely enlighten me I’m all in on bitcoin and I did the “research” and was disappointed, heavily disappointed

It looks like **you should sell it all**, mate. It's pointless to be heavily disappointed if you did the ""research"". Or shut the duck up and start learning. ||| Energy production as well as the efficency of the machines doing the mining are improving as well. Ai wasting much more energy. ||| >Am I missing something here? 

Yes.

Bitcoin is pseudo-anonymous, in that the wallet address can be linked to a personal identity. KYC is the government's way of tracking you for taxation and financial crimes.

The Lightning Network is sufficient for smaller day-to-day transactions.

It can't be easily corrupted by big corpos or governments because of it's decentralized nature. They can own a significant supply, but it's value comes when it is used. They can't hoard it forever and are incentivized to trade in it. The real hoarding of wealth is seen in today's world where newly printed money goes to the wealthiest. That is under a centralized economy (the Fed).

It's scarcity isn't it's only pro. It's digital. Unlike gold, a billion dollars can be sent anywhere in the world in a few seconds to minutes. Even with fiat that could take weeks or longer.  There are literally billions of people in this world without access to traditional banking services. But many have access to a smart phone and the internet. 

Unlike real estate, it doesn't have to worry about falling apart and needing expensive repairs, doesn't have to worry about property taxes or renting out to tenants. It solved the double spend problem via a decentralized proof-of-work consensus.

Even if it's banned, people will still use it. Marijuana was banned for the longest time and people still use. Imagine if the government banned diamonds but you kept some in secret. Well Bitcoin is infinitely more valuable than diamonds.

The energy consumption is a lot, but so is global finance. The competition among miners encourages continuous striving for more energy efficient acquisition."

In return, they issued paper banknotes. These banknotes began to circulate as a medium of exchange. When the bankers realized that no one was coming to get their gold and that everyone was using the banknotes as money, they started issuing banknotes as debt with interest. This is how today’s monetary system arose. Fiat currencies are essentially debt with interest.

Use Bitcoin as your money. If you receive fiat currency that is essentially debt with interest. and you don’t plan to spend it immediately, convert it into Bitcoin for long-term [savings.You](http://savings.You) don’t need to follow exchange rates or watch them constantly. Bitcoin is hard money and, in the long term, it will outperform fiat currencies. If this isn’t clear to you yet, you need to study Bitcoin, money its forms throughout history, fiat systems, inflation, Also, check out Saifedean’s podcasts and read his book *The Fiat Standard*. [etc.so](http://etc.so) that it becomes clear. Once you understand this, it’s like waking up from the Matrix. There’s no turning back. ||| My simple advice. Ignore current price. You are already starting to appreciate the fundamentals.

Instead, take 3-5% of your investable assets and YOLO into Bitcoin now, then choose an appropriate amount and being dollar cost averaging every 2 weeks as you get paid. Not too much or you'll get scared, but enough that you feel it accumulating.

Next, educate yourself more on Bitcoin - the why. I recommend The Bitcoin Standard, but there are plenty of other resources. Over time you may want to accumulate more. Just don't invest more than you are willing to lose as otherwise you are likely to sell at the worst time. ||| In the beginner subreddit ||| Step 1. Buy Bitcoin

The difference is, your bank has total control about the numbers on your account. The database for bitcoin is the blockchain, which is decentralized over some thousand nodes (according to [https://bitnodes.io/](https://bitnodes.io/) currently 23 tousand) so no single entity can change the number of bitcoins you own. The only things that will change the numbers in your wallet are transactions: either someone sends you coins, or you send coins to someone. 

If you ""mine"" bitcoins, you bundle valid transactions into new blocks for the blockchain, and include one special transaction that adds the block reward to your wallet's address. ||| The very best ""basic"" explanation of what a bitcoin really *is* that I've seen came from [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBC-nXj3Ng4) which I always recommend anyone to check out.

It guides you from the very basics, to asking what an ideal monetary system should look like, to bitcoin as a logical conclusion. ||| Read the Satoshi white paper (about 10 pages). Bitcoin Standard (a book). ||| I'd recommend going to https://bitcoin.it then soaking up all the technical information over there. The nuances of what is going on on the blockchain cannot be explained in a short answer on Reddit. You need to get your hands dirty and understand some cryptography basics. Start a new chat with ChatGPT then ask any question that comes to your mind, or just Google it if you prefer learning that way. When you're ready, look into doing fake transactions on Bitcoin's Testnet. This is a great way to learn as there are no risks of losing funds. This will give you a good grasp on how it all works. ||| At the code level, a bitcoin is not an object but a set of satoshi-denominated UTXOs tracked in the ledger, enforced by consensus and manipulated via scripts.

Base unit:
Bitcoin is measured in satoshis (sat).
1 BTC = 100,000,000 sats.
In Bitcoin Core, values are stored as 64-bit integers (CAmount), denominated in sats.

UTXOs (Unspent Transaction Outputs):
What you actually “own” are UTXOs. Each UTXO has:

a value (in sats), and

a locking script (scriptPubKey) that defines how it can be spent.
Ownership = ability to provide a valid unlocking script (scriptSig/witness) for those outputs.

Transactions:
Move value by consuming previous UTXOs as inputs and creating new UTXOs as outputs.
Inputs reference prior outputs by txid:vout, and provide signatures.
Outputs define new locking scripts and values.

Consensus rules:
Ensure total input ≥ total output + fee, signatures are valid, scripts execute to true, and no inflation beyond the subsidy schedule."

If you want to get into bitcoin, I think baby's first steps are very simple:

1. Buy bitcoin from a reputable exchange like Strike, River, Kraken, or Coinbase.
2. Get a hardware wallet like a Coldcard, Trezor, Jade, or Bitbox02. Preferably a bitcoin-only model. Buy directly from the manufacturer. Very carefully read the instructions that come with it and move your bitcoin to the wallet.
3. Sit on it long term.

That's it. You're done. No telegram groups, no get rich quick schemes. Literally just get yourself some bitcoin and learn how to take custody of it.

For beginner stuff, consider grabbing a book like The Bitcoin Standard or Broken Money. They're similar. Broken Money is the better book, but Bitcoin Standard is definitely a much easier read and usually everyone's first book.

It doesn’t stop anyone either buying on an exchange not registered in the UK or buying on a person to person basis. ||| There’s a lot of confused ideas in your post:

1. The Financial Conduct Authority regulates business, not retail investors. It is in theory there to make sure these businesses meet minimum standards and don’t screw their customers over. Sometimes they are successful in this goal.

2. An ETN is an Exchange Traded Note. This is a securitised product purportedly backed by or whose value is tied to an asset, in this case crypto. To buy these, you need an account provided by an FCA regulated provider. The FCA has until now banned UK providers from letting UK customers buy crypto ETNs. This is important for things like tax-advantaged pensions and ISA accounts, but if you just want to buy Bitcoin directly then you probably wouldn’t buy one. Most people who own Bitcoin in the UK would just buy it and not buy an ETN, but if you have an ISA for tax efficiency you may be able to buy Bitcoin ETNs with it in future. You won’t be part of the peer-to-peer money system with a ETN, but you will at least get “money go up” with protection from taxes.

3. A business that isn’t regulated in the UK can sell you Bitcoin, but if it isn’t in some way registered or regulated by the FCA it can’t approach you - say, with an advert. You must approach them. Like that girl you fancied in school, an unregulated/ unregistered exchange can’t make the first move to an UK customer. This actually gets technical at a legal level so some exchanges will just tell you they aren’t going to sell to you if they are not FCA registered. 

4. Many exchanges are now registered or regulated in the UK, and they get that registration or licence from the FCA. In theory you as a retail buyer should be more comfortable with exchanges that the FCA registers. In practice, if you take self custody straight after buying like a good hodler, there isn’t much difference as long as the exchange has a good reputation.

Higher difficulty just means there is more mining activity (more miners or improved hardware).  With basically the same amount of coin up for grabs.  It’s competition among miners that makes things difficult for miners, not the math.

There’s no need to be nervous or constantly follow exchange rate. If you want more excitement, go to a casino and play red or black. ||| Volatility is dying partly because there are now deep liquidity options contracts available via IBIT. Options always will suck the volatility out of any asset. In order for bigger moves, we need greater and greater liquidity into BTC, which at the current market cycle isn't happening yet. Maybe after a few rate cuts and more nation + corp adoption we'll see heavier ticks up and down... Maybe not. I'm not sold on the permanent diminishing returns thesis people are pushing, mostly because global BTC adoption is apparently around 3%. Which is 1990's internet infancy. ||| Sell it. This thing is not for the faint hearted. ||| Alright, so. Personally I think this cycle is different from past cycles because this cycle to me is about trading sideways for 3-6 months at a time then jump up. For example.

Since the ETFS were approved, from February to October we traded between 50-70k. Election happens, we jump up then trade between 90-110k from November to July then we jumped up to 124k. We have been trading between 110-125 since July and my guess will continue till rate cuts then we jumped to 130s-140s and don’t be surprised if we trade sideways there for a bit.
The volatility is going to continue to go away over time but it’s still there and still plenty of time to take advantage before we go even higher. Keep in mind this also means the bear market will be different as well but no one knows the severity of it. Good luck! ||| Not sure what you are scared about, we are in uncharted territory right now, we have been above 100k for a long time.

1n9nzqh;Market volatility;Accomplished-Set9014;18;14;1757125368.0;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1n9nzqh/market_volatility/;"One of the biggest traps people fall into when watching Bitcoin is trying to map every tick in price to some event, headline, or report. You saw the jobs numbers come out, the market move one way, Bitcoin follow, and then both reverse—and you’re trying to decode it like it’s a perfectly logical system. But markets, especially Bitcoin, don’t work that cleanly.

Bitcoin isn’t tethered to one piece of economic data or one market cycle. In the short term, sure, it can look like it’s moving in lockstep with equities or reacting to macro news. That’s because traders, institutions, and even bots are plugged into both markets at the same time. The same funds that rebalance stocks are the ones that hold Bitcoin exposure, so naturally there’s going to be some correlation in the daily noise. But that doesn’t mean Bitcoin’s destiny is to shadow the S&P forever—it just means the same capital is sloshing around.

Zoom out. Bitcoin’s story is not about a single jobs report, or even about whether the stock market is red or green today. It’s about being a scarce, global, non-sovereign money that’s running on a network no one controls. That’s not something you can measure by watching intraday candles. Over a long enough timeline, Bitcoin has shrugged off wars, inflation scares, rate hikes, rate cuts, bank collapses, and everything in between. Each time, people thought “this news will define Bitcoin’s future,” and each time, Bitcoin simply kept following its own adoption curve.

So if you catch yourself micromanaging the charts with every piece of macro data, you’re missing the bigger picture. Bitcoin wasn’t built to win or lose based on a single government statistic—it was built to outlast them. The volatility is the price you pay for holding something that’s still in the middle of being discovered by the world. ||| Bitcoin in aggregate is an uncorrelated asset:

https://www.wisdomtree.com/-/media/us-media-files/documents/resource-library/market-insights/gannatti-commentary/bitcoin-correlations.pdf https://www.wisdomtree.com/-/media/us-media-files/documents/resource-library/market-insights/gannatti-commentary/bitcoin-correlations.pdf

What that means is that on any given day, it could follow the markets or it could not.  There are also periods where you will see positive correlation and periods with negative correlation and periods with no correlation. 

You highlight that it went down today with the markets, but didn’t mention that earlier this week it went up when the markets went down.

You will also see more correlation when the macro environment is changing (rates up or down…policy changes…etc) as trading markets as a whole are being impacted. ||| It's a very liquid market that trades 24/7 and is very sensitive to macro / geopolitical news. Often times it is one of the only things that is actually open to buy/sell when the news hits, so bitcoin can be a good barometer. I think what you're missing is you're looking at the daily / hourly chart. If you zoom out, you see it has historically followed its own 4 year cycle that is unlike anything else. Don't confuse the day to day action with the bigger picture. ||| yes. Your measuring stick is using the wrong denominator. Fiat is mushy and unstable. Look at other metrics like hash rate or purchasing power. Expand the timeline. Day to day price volatility is probably the least interesting aspect of Bitcoin. The price ratio to fiat is noise. When the price was floating from $12k to $11k does that matter now? At all? When it hits $1m will $120k or $110k matter? At all? ||| Bitcoin has always been uncorrelated. The thing is: as more and more ppl adopt it, it starts reflecting the general sentiment of the world.

Good times? Bitcoin is up. Bad times and people struggling? Bitcoin is down.

 People buy when they are well off enough that they don't have to worry about a meal on the table. People sell when they need the fiat to fund their survivability.  I believe it to be that simple when you don't include the ""traders"". Most people are just trying to get by in this world."

In the worst possible outcome, make a detour to a crypto friendly hub where you can sell your crypto and wire it to the country where you are going to (dubai/hong kong) 

The last option will cost you approx 5-10% of the current rate. ||| Cashing out large crypto positions can be surprisingly difficult even for legitimate holders. This is especially true for early adopters who used multiple exchanges over the years, including platforms that no longer exist.

Even crypto-friendly banks remain highly cautious due to regulatory pressure and historical associations with illicit activity. In many cases, the hardest part isn’t converting crypto to fiat it’s getting the fiat accepted and deposited safely without triggering a freeze or rejection.

A few things are critical to prepare in advance:

Document your entire transaction history and provenance (sometimes going back a decade).

Maintain a clear audit trail of wallets, counterparties, and exchanges.

Anticipate complex compliance reviews that are often misunderstood by front-office staff.

Without proper preparation, it’s common to face weeks or months of delays, repeated document requests, or outright refusals.

One overlooked problem: early wallets are sometimes flagged as “tainted” because of exposure to exchanges like Mt. Gox, BTC-e, or Cryptsy. Blockchain forensic tools such as Scorechain assign risk scores to this historical activity even if all funds are perfectly legitimate today. Addressing this requires clear documentation and, in some cases, assistance from a regulated intermediary who can contextualize the forensic hits.

I work professionally in this space (Swiss-regulated financial intermediary) and have helped clients manage these exact challenges from tracing the source of funds to onboarding with private banks.

When crypto plummets, it’s going to fucking hurt to know that your buddy, if he bought in due to your “advice”, is going to come straight at you blaming you for losing money. 

1) if you convinced him to buy in and hold long term (more than 4 years) and withstand the downturns, then it’s fine. 
2) if you convinced him to invest money he’s willing to lose, then it’s ok. 
3) if he’s thinking he’s going to get rich next month… no bueno. 

This is coming from someone that convinced their friends, parents, in-laws, to buy during the 2017 peak.   It it dipped for 3 fucking years and it was the most painful experience anybody can endure. Thankfully they actually held long term, because I was very very clear on that premise. Once they broke even, it was the biggest sigh of relief I have ever experienced in my life. Mind you, I’m talking about them investing 10’s of thousands of dollars. Not a few hundred, thousands. 

So, in short: be cautious how you come across when talking about Bitcoin."

I would definitely read a book called “The Bitcoin Standard” so you can have a deeper understanding of BTC. And then beyond that I would simply suggest to keep a long term mindset on this asset. Buy as much as you can and hold for at least 5 years (preferably 10+). ||| Welcome abroad. You're the only person who can answer these questions mate. We all have been where you're at right now.

Congrats on the move, it's never too late, [despite new people thinking otherwise](https://old.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/rskpuf/i_have_only_600_bitcoinsi_missed_the_bus/). ONLY INVEST MONEY YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE. 

Invest in your knowledge, learn about Bitcoin as much as you can. The Bitcoin Standard book is a must read. So is Broken Money book. Get them and READ them both, please. 

Also, **don't reply any DMs**, emails, private messages on other social media, promising to buy Bitcoin from them or get rich quick by investing into some website. They all are scammers. Even the hot Asian chick, he's a scammer too. 

**Price wise, nobody knows what the price will be tomorrow, next week or at the end of the year.** 

**Try ""Bitcoin ONLY"" strategy for at least the first 210,000 block cycle**, you'll sleep much better. Newcomers lose so much money, holding garbage tokens just because someone on YT told them to. If you don't like losing money in [failed coins](https://www.coingecko.com/research/publications/how-many-cryptocurrencies-failed), avoid. 

Going DCA is probably the best approach, IMHO. 
Bitcoin to me, is a savings account. If I have some spare cash, I exchange it for sats. Once a week works best for me, but I'm getting paid weekly. If there's a 10% drop in the price since my last buy, I usually double my buy. This [DCA calculator](https://dca.bitnob.com/) might help to decide what will work best for you. In a few years, even $10 dollars a month can make a massive difference. This [DCA blog](https://er-bybitcoin.com/) is pretty interesting too and compares buying bitcoin VS stocks. 

Now, don't buy some fake bitcoin at a spot ETF place or similar, **get the real thing** that you can withdraw anytime you want. Register at a proper exchange and buy real Bitcoin. Any of these will do [https://bitcoin-only.com/get-bitcoin](https://bitcoin-only.com/get-bitcoin) 

Install (or buy - in case you're getting Bitcoin in Thousands of $) one or more of these wallets.

**A few good wallet choices:**

[https://blockstream.com/green/](https://blockstream.com/green/) \- Top Security Features, Open Source and Non-Custodial

[https://bluewallet.io](https://bluewallet.io/) \- excellent, easy to use wallet, Open Source and Non-Custodial 

[https://www.sparrowwallet.com](https://www.sparrowwallet.com) - top desktop wallet 

[https://electrum.org](https://electrum.org/) \- Solid choice, Open Source and Non-Custodial, one of the oldest and most trusted Bitcoin Wallets. I prefer the desktop version but it works on mobile too.

**Lightning wallets** to consider (cheaper and faster transactions, great for small amounts):

[https://phoenix.acinq.co/](https://phoenix.acinq.co/) \- Phoenix - very good wallet, uses Tor for extra privacy, easy for anyone new 

[https://blixtwallet.github.io/](https://blixtwallet.github.io/) \- Blixt - great UI, fast and clean 

[https://zeusln.com/](https://zeusln.com/) Zeus - impressive wallet with many features, can even generate Nostr keys

[https://breez.technology](https://breez.technology/) \- Breez - excellent POS for small business owners as well as integrated Bitrefill 

Note: Breez does also a hybrid liquid/LN wallet called Misty Breez - the sats being on liquid means no need for channels although the payments take a few extra seconds. You'll also can get a free customable LN address. 

While talking about hybrid wallets, there's also Aqua Wallet although not IMHO as good as Misty Breez.

There are also custodial LN wallet but I would honestly avoid using them because you have to trust the wallet operator not to steal your money. Their only advantage is that they are incredibly easy to use, although it might cost you big one day.


**Hardware Wallets** (to store larger amounts):

[Trezor](https://trezor.io/) \- Easy to use, no matter how new in Bitcoin you're. Use the Bitcoin only firmware as it's safer than a multi coin software. 

[ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/) - air gapped, Bitcoin only, has advanced features but a new user will do fine with one of the great tutorials available.

[BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/bitcoin-only/) - another great little device, opt for the more secure Bitcoin ONLY version (less coins = less code = less chance for a hidden bug or a backdoor) 

[Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade) - air gapped, fully open source, Bitcoin only, great features. There's a newer version called Jade Plus, it has much better camera and overall is a better, although a bit more expensive, option. 

You can even [build it on your own](https://github.com/Blockstream/jade/), if you feel adventurous.  

[Seedsigner](https://github.com/SeedSigner/seedsigner) - another DIY, fully open source, air gapped, Bitcoin only hardware wallet, not for you if you're just starting up but something to consider later.

[Krux wallet](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/) - one more DIY hardware device, I love this one for many reasons. Similar to Seedsigner, it's fully open source, air gapped, Bitcoin only hardware wallet, that is not for you right now if you're just starting up, but something to consider at a later stage and/or to up the security of your bitcoin. 


There's also Ledger, but I wouldn't recommend it as it's not fully open source, keep and already leaked customers' details, recently said they're capable of sending customers' keys out just with a firmware update, etc. **Stay away**, save yourself a headache in the future. 

Whatever wallet you'll decide to buy, purchase DIRECTLY from the manufacturer, no eBay, no Amazon. 

Make sure the device is NOT preset, and you will generate your own seed words. Write them down on any piece of paper as well as the receiving address. Now wipe the wallet and generate a new wallet. If the seed words are different from the first set, you're safe to use it. 

Find an option to set a passphrase and use it. This will boost the security to another level. Never store the seed words and passphrase together. Use a different medium if possible. If somebody finds both, they'll be able to steal your coin. 

This little device will hold the keys to your money, that's the reason why you have to be a bit more careful. Also, no worries, if it breaks, you can replace it - as long as you keep your seed words and passphrase(s) safe.

It’s increased in value over time because of multiple factors. Transparency, scarcity, no central control. If one of those factors were to change, holders would try to sell and there would be less buying interest so the sellers would be willing to accept less and less until price equilibrium was reached between buyers and sellers. It’s a huge, liquid market right now. 10s of trillions of dollars change hands each year. ||| If all bitcoin were held by one person then all mining will stop and the network will naturally go away. This means that you would have to run a full node and all bitcoin will be contained in your node. Because there will no longer by a means to send btc, the value will be negative because it will cost money to maintain the node. The biggest factor to bitcoins value is its adoption, recognition and reputation."

Why choose to pay an ETFs expense ratio, if you were comfortable doing self storage for many years? ||| Thats gonna be a no from me, dawg. ||| Depends where you are, but moving to an ETF is a taxable event in my Country of residence as you are no longer in control of the private keys.
